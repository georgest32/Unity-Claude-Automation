# Manifest-Based Startup Fixes Summary
## Date: 2025-08-22
## Phase 3 Day 2: Migration and Backward Compatibility

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Path Resolution Issue
**Problem**: StartScript paths in manifests were being resolved relative to the Manifests directory instead of project root
**Solution**: Modified `Register-SubsystemFromManifest.ps1` to resolve paths from project root first, then fall back to manifest directory

### 2. UTF-8 BOM in Manifest Files
**Problem**: Manifest files had UTF-8 BOM causing PowerShell data file parsing to fail
**Solution**: Created and ran `Fix-ManifestBOM.ps1` to remove BOM from all manifest files

### 3. Missing ModulePath Parameter
**Problem**: `Register-Subsystem` requires ModulePath but `Register-SubsystemFromManifest` wasn't providing it
**Solution**: Updated to use StartScript as ModulePath, with fallback to default module path pattern

### 4. Mutex Enforcement Not Working
**Problem**: Mutex check looked for `UseMutex` property but manifests only had `MutexName`
**Solution**: Modified check to work if either `UseMutex` or `MutexName` is present

### 5. Incorrect Dependency Names
**Problem**: Manifests referenced "SystemStatus" but actual subsystem name is "SystemMonitoring"
**Solution**: Updated Dependencies in AutonomousAgent and CLISubmission manifests

### 6. Missing Closing Brace
**Problem**: `Register-Subsystem.ps1` had a missing closing brace causing syntax errors
**Solution**: Added missing closing brace at end of function

### 7. String Interpolation Error
**Problem**: Legacy-Compatibility.psm1 had incorrect variable interpolation syntax
**Solution**: Fixed to use `${variableName}` syntax for proper interpolation

## Files Modified

1. **Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/Core/Register-SubsystemFromManifest.ps1**
   - Fixed path resolution logic
   - Added ModulePath parameter to Register-Subsystem call
   - Fixed mutex detection logic

2. **Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/Core/Test-SubsystemManifest.ps1**
   - Fixed path resolution for StartScript validation

3. **Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/Core/Register-Subsystem.ps1**
   - Fixed missing closing brace

4. **Migration/Legacy-Compatibility.psm1**
   - Fixed string interpolation syntax
   - Improved error handling for manifest startup

5. **Manifests/AutonomousAgent.manifest.psd1**
   - Removed UTF-8 BOM
   - Fixed dependency name (SystemStatus -> SystemMonitoring)

6. **Manifests/CLISubmission.manifest.psd1**
   - Removed UTF-8 BOM
   - Fixed dependency name (SystemStatus -> SystemMonitoring)

7. **Manifests/SystemMonitoring.manifest.psd1**
   - Removed UTF-8 BOM

## Testing

Run the following to test manifest-based startup:
```powershell
# Test manifest discovery and validation
.\Test-ManifestStartup.ps1

# Run full manifest-based startup
.\Start-UnifiedSystem-WithCompatibility.ps1 -UseManifestMode
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete manifest-based startup with all fixes
2. Monitor for any remaining issues with multiple instance spawning
3. Consider adding better process management to prevent runaway subsystem starts
4. Document the migration process for other developers

## Notes

- The manifest-based system provides better dependency management and resource control
- Mutex enforcement prevents multiple instances of the same subsystem
- The backward compatibility layer allows graceful fallback to legacy mode if needed
- All manifests are now properly formatted PowerShell data files without BOM
