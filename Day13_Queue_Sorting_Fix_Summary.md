# Day 13 CLI Automation - Queue Sorting Algorithm Fix
*Date: 2025-01-18 | Type: Algorithm Fix | Resolution: Complete*
*Previous: Debug infrastructure | Topics: PowerShell 5.1 sorting, string vs numeric comparison*

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Identified
The queue prioritization test was failing because PowerShell 5.1's Sort-Object cmdlet was treating numeric Priority values as strings, causing incorrect alphabetical sorting instead of numerical sorting.

### Evidence from Debug Logs
```
Before sorting: 1, 10, 5
After sorting: 10, 1, 5    # Should be: 10, 5, 1
```

The issue was clear: `1` was being sorted before `5` because in string comparison, "1" comes before "5" alphabetically, regardless of numeric value.

### Performance Test Logs Confirmed Pattern
```
Before sorting: 9, 7, 7, 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 9
After sorting: 9, 7, 7, 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 9
```

The last `9` ended up at the end instead of being grouped with other `9`s at the beginning, confirming string-based comparison.

## Research Findings

### PowerShell 5.1 Sort-Object Behavior
1. **String Comparison Default**: Sort-Object performs string comparison by default
2. **No Stable Sort**: PowerShell 5.1 lacks stable sort features (introduced in PowerShell 7+)
3. **Type Casting Required**: Must explicitly cast to proper types for numeric sorting
4. **JSON Deserialization**: PSObjects from JSON may store numbers as strings

### Common Solutions
1. **Type Casting**: `Sort-Object -Property { [int]$_.Priority }`
2. **Version Casting**: `Sort-Object { [version] $_.Property }`
3. **Regex Padding**: For complex alphanumeric sorting
4. **Custom Comparison**: Using StrCmpLogicalW API for natural sorting

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied
Changed the sorting logic in `Add-InputToQueue` function:

```powershell
# Before (string sorting)
$queue.Queue = $queueArray | Sort-Object -Property Priority -Descending

# After (numeric sorting)
$queue.Queue = $queueArray | Sort-Object -Property { [int]$_.Priority } -Descending
```

### Technical Details
- Cast Priority property to `[int]` type for proper numeric comparison
- Maintains descending order (highest priority first)
- Compatible with PowerShell 5.1 limitations
- Works with PSObjects from JSON deserialization

## Expected Results

### Queue Sorting Behavior
With the fix, priority values should now sort correctly:
- Input: `1, 10, 5` 
- Output: `10, 5, 1` (proper numeric descending order)

### Test Expected Outcome
The queue prioritization test should now pass:
```
Actual priorities: 10, 5, 1
Expected priorities: 10, 5, 1
âœ… [PASS] Queue prioritization works correctly
```

## Files Modified
1. **CLIAutomation.psm1** - Fixed Sort-Object call with [int] casting
2. **IMPORTANT_LEARNINGS.md** - Added Learning #133
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Added HOTFIX 6 note
4. **unity_claude_automation.log** - Logged fix session

## Critical Learnings

### PowerShell Sorting Best Practices
1. Always cast numeric properties to appropriate types when sorting
2. Be aware of string vs numeric comparison differences
3. PowerShell 5.1 requires explicit type handling for proper sorting
4. JSON deserialization may affect data types in unexpected ways

### Prevention Strategies
1. Test sorting with various numeric ranges during development
2. Use debug logging to verify sort behavior
3. Consider PowerShell version differences when designing sort logic
4. Validate data types after JSON operations
