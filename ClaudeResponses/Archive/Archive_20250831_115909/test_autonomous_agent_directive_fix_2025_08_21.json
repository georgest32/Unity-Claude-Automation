  "purpose": "Test that autonomous agent extracts only RECOMMENDATION line and appends directive correctly",
  "response": "Fixed the autonomous agent prompt duplication issue successfully. The agent now extracts only the recommendation line instead of submitting the entire response content. This eliminates overly long prompts and ensures proper autonomous operation.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: TEST AutonomousAgentDirectiveFix: Run autonomous monitoring test to verify no duplicate directives appear and recommendation format works correctly\n\nThe fix involved updating Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1 to extract the RECOMMENDATION line and append the simple directive format."
