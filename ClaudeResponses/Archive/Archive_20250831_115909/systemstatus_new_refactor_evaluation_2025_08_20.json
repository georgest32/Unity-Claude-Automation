    "migration_steps": [
      "1. Backup current Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus directory",

  "risk_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "LOW",
    "potential_issues": [
      "Loading performance with 46 files (mitigated by small file sizes)",
      "Slightly more complex file structure (offset by better organization)"
    ],
    "mitigation": [
      "Files are small so loading impact minimal",
      "Directory structure is logical and well-organized",
      "PowerShell handles recursive loading efficiently"
    ]
  },
  
  "next_steps": [
    "Test the new module structure with Test-NewRefactoredModule.ps1",
    "Validate all 46 functions are available and working",
    "Compare performance with original module",
    "If successful, replace current refactoring attempt",
    "Update documentation with new structure"
  ],
  
  "conclusion": "The new Unity-Claude-SystemStatus folder provides an EXCELLENT solution to the current refactoring challenges. It uses a proven function-per-file approach that eliminates all the Export-ModuleMember and dot-sourcing issues we've been encountering. This structure is highly recommended for adoption."
