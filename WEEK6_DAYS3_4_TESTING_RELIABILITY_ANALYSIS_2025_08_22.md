## üî¨ Research Findings (5 Web Queries Completed)

### Notification System Reliability Testing Research 2025
**Queries Completed**: 5/5 (Testing and reliability focus)
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **SMTP Testing and Validation (PowerShell 5.1)**:
   - Send-MailMessage cmdlet for basic SMTP testing but lacks detailed feedback
   - Test-SmtpConnectivity available in Exchange environments for comprehensive diagnostics
   - Raw socket connections via .NET classes for deeper SMTP protocol validation
   - Port considerations: 587 (TLS), 465 (SSL), 25 (unencrypted), 2525 (alternative)
   - Authentication validation critical for Gmail, Office 365, corporate SMTP

2. **Webhook Reliability Testing (Invoke-RestMethod)**:
   - PowerShell 6+ has built-in RetryIntervalSec and retry functionality for 400-599 status codes
   - Custom retry loops required for PowerShell 5.1 webhook reliability
   - Status code validation challenges in PowerShell 5.1 (limited -StatusCodeVariable support)
   - Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascading failures with retry-sensitive logic
   - HTTP status validation critical for webhook delivery confirmation

3. **Dead Letter Queue and Retry Patterns**:
   - Exponential backoff with jitter prevents "thundering herd" collisions
   - Maximum retry limits prevent infinite loops (typical: 3-5 attempts)
   - Dead letter queues for failed message persistence and manual intervention
   - Redrive policies for automatic DLQ message replay after resolution
   - Transient vs permanent error classification for intelligent retry

4. **Performance Testing and Metrics (2025)**:
   - Key metrics: Uptime, error rates, transaction success rate, concurrent users, throughput
   - PowerShell performance counters via Get-Counter for resource monitoring
   - Load testing tools: Gatling for high concurrent loads, custom PowerShell scripts
   - Real-time monitoring with CPU, memory, disk, network utilization tracking
   - CI/CD integration for automated performance validation

5. **Multi-Channel Fallback Systems**:
   - Industry best practice: 2+ notification channels for redundancy (email + SMS/webhook)
   - Dynamic provider load balancing based on performance metrics
   - Real-time health checks with seamless failover (<5 seconds)
   - Omnichannel approach: Email -> SMS -> WhatsApp -> Push notifications
   - State management and intelligent routing for delivery confirmation

### Implementation Implications for Week 6 Days 3-4
- **PowerShell 5.1 Constraints**: Custom retry implementation needed for webhook reliability
- **Testing Framework**: Combine Send-MailMessage and Invoke-RestMethod for delivery validation
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implement Polly pattern for resilient notification delivery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use Get-Counter for resource utilization tracking
- **Fallback Logic**: Multi-channel approach with intelligent priority ordering
