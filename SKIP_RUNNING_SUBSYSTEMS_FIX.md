# Skip Running Subsystems Fix
## Date: 2025-08-22
## Issue: Manifest-based startup failing when subsystems already running

## Problem
When the manifest-based startup tried to start SystemMonitoring, it failed because the mutex was already held (the subsystem was already running). This caused the entire manifest-based startup to abort and fall back to legacy mode, even though other subsystems could have been started.

## Root Cause
The `Register-SubsystemFromManifest` function would throw an exception when it couldn't acquire a mutex, instead of gracefully handling the case where a subsystem is already running.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Register-SubsystemFromManifest.ps1
- Changed mutex acquisition failure from throwing an exception to returning a "skipped" status
- Returns `{Success: false, Skipped: true}` when subsystem is already running
- Allows startup to continue with other subsystems

### 2. Updated Legacy-Compatibility.psm1
- Added handling for "skipped" status from Register-SubsystemFromManifest
- Counts already-running subsystems as "started" in the final tally
- Shows appropriate message: "Already running (skipped)"

### 3. Created Test-SubsystemRunning.ps1
- New function to proactively check if a subsystem is running
- Checks both mutex status and process status
- Allows pre-checking before attempting to start

### 4. Added Pre-check Logic
- Manifest-based startup now checks if subsystems are already running
- Skips them without attempting to acquire mutex
- More efficient and cleaner logging

## Files Modified

1. **Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/Core/Register-SubsystemFromManifest.ps1**
   - Line 148-157: Changed mutex failure handling to return skipped status

2. **Migration/Legacy-Compatibility.psm1**
   - Line 296-306: Added handling for skipped subsystems
   - Line 294-302: Added pre-check using Test-SubsystemRunning

3. **Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/Core/Test-SubsystemRunning.ps1** (NEW)
   - Complete new file for checking subsystem running status

4. **Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus.psm1**
   - Added Test-SubsystemRunning to exported functions

## Testing
Run `.\Test-SkipRunningSubsystems.ps1` to verify the fix works correctly.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. SystemMonitoring already running → Skip it, show "Already running"
2. AutonomousAgent not running → Start it normally
3. CLISubmission not running → Start it normally
4. Overall result: Success (with some subsystems skipped)

## Benefits

- No more failures when subsystems are already running
- Graceful handling of partial startups
- Better user feedback about what's running
- System can continue with other subsystems even if some are already active
