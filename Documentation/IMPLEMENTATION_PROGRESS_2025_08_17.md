### Key Components Needed
1. **FileSystemWatcher Setup**
   - Monitor Editor.log for changes
   - Monitor current_errors.json
   - Debounce rapid changes

2. **Error Pattern Detection**
   - Parse new log entries
   - Identify compilation errors
   - Group related errors

3. **Submission Logic**
   - Check if errors are new
   - Avoid duplicate submissions
   - Queue management

4. **Fix Application**
   - Parse Claude responses
   - Apply code changes
   - Trigger recompilation

5. **Verification Loop**
   - Check if errors resolved
   - Handle partial fixes
   - Retry logic

## Research Topics for Next Phase
1. PowerShell FileSystemWatcher best practices
2. Debouncing file change events
3. Queue management for error submissions
4. Retry strategies for failed fixes
5. State management in long-running scripts

## Closing Summary
The Unity-Claude Automation system has achieved significant milestones with bidirectional communication and rapid compilation working. The next critical step is implementing periodic monitoring mode to achieve true zero-touch operation. With the server infrastructure in place and error detection functioning, we can now focus on the continuous monitoring loop that will automatically detect, submit, and fix Unity compilation errors without user intervention.

The implementation should prioritize reliability over speed, with proper error handling and retry logic. The system should be resilient to partial fixes and capable of learning from successful resolutions.
