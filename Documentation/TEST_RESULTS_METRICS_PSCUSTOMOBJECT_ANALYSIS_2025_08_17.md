# Test Results Analysis: Measure-Object Property Access Issues
*Date: 2025-08-17 21:00*
*Context: Week 2 Day 8-9 Implementation - Fixing Metrics Collection Property Access*
*Previous Topics: Phase 3 implementation, JSON type conversion, ++ operator fix*

## Summary Information

**Problem**: Measure-Object cannot find properties "ConfidenceScore" and "ExecutionTimeMs" in metrics collection
**Date/Time**: 2025-08-17 21:00
**Previous Context**: Fixed ++ operator issue but created hashtables that don't expose properties to Measure-Object
**Topics Involved**: PowerShell property access, hashtable vs PSCustomObject, Measure-Object requirements

## Current Project State Analysis

### Home State Review
- **Project Root**: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation\
- **PowerShell**: 5.1 compatibility maintained
- **Current Issue**: Metrics stored as hashtables, but Measure-Object needs PSCustomObject properties

### Error Analysis

#### Primary Error: Property Not Found
**Location**: Unity-Claude-Learning.psm1, lines 1738-1739
```powershell
$analytics.AverageConfidence = [math]::Round(($metrics | Measure-Object -Property ConfidenceScore -Average).Average, 4)
$analytics.AverageExecutionTime = [math]::Round(($metrics | Measure-Object -Property ExecutionTimeMs -Average).Average, 2)
```

**Error Messages**:
- "The property 'ConfidenceScore' cannot be found in the input for any objects"
- "The property 'ExecutionTimeMs' cannot be found in the input for any objects"

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. Previous fix converted PSCustomObject from JSON to hashtables
2. Hashtables store data as key-value pairs, not as properties
3. Measure-Object requires actual object properties, not hashtable keys
4. Need PSCustomObjects with properties for Measure-Object to work

#### Secondary Issue: Type Conversion
- "Cannot convert the 'System.Object[]' value of type 'System.Object[]' to type 'System.Int32'"
- Still occurring when trying to access integer values that are arrays

## Solution Implementation

### Fix Strategy
Convert metrics to PSCustomObjects instead of hashtables so properties are accessible:

1. Use `[PSCustomObject]` type accelerator to create objects with properties
2. Ensure all numeric properties are properly typed during conversion
3. Maintain PowerShell 5.1 compatibility

### Implementation Details

Instead of creating hashtables:
```powershell
$metric = @{ 
    MetricID = [string]$metricObj.MetricID 
    # ... 
}
```

Create PSCustomObjects:
```powershell
$metric = [PSCustomObject]@{
    MetricID = [string]$metricObj.MetricID
    PatternID = [string]$metricObj.PatternID
    ConfidenceScore = [double]$metricObj.ConfidenceScore
    Success = [bool]$metricObj.Success
    ExecutionTimeMs = [int]$metricObj.ExecutionTimeMs
    ErrorMessage = [string]$metricObj.ErrorMessage
    Context = [string]$metricObj.Context
    Timestamp = [string]$metricObj.Timestamp
}
```

This ensures:
- Properties are accessible to Measure-Object
- Type conversion is explicit
- PowerShell 5.1 compatibility maintained
- Properties behave like object properties, not hashtable keys

## Testing Verification

After fix, verify:
1. Measure-Object can access ConfidenceScore property
2. Measure-Object can access ExecutionTimeMs property  
3. No type conversion errors for integers
4. All 8 test scenarios pass

## Closing Summary

**Key Finding**: PowerShell's Measure-Object cmdlet requires actual object properties, not hashtable keys. Converting to PSCustomObject resolves property access issues.

**Solution**: Use `[PSCustomObject]` type accelerator to create objects with properly typed properties that Measure-Object can access.

**Expected Outcome**: All metrics analysis functions should work correctly with proper property access.

## Lineage of Analysis

**Previous Context**: Fixed ++ operator issue by converting to hashtables
**Current Focus**: Fixing property access for Measure-Object cmdlet
**Discovery**: Hashtables don't expose properties to cmdlets like Measure-Object
**Next Steps**: Convert hashtables to PSCustomObjects for proper property access
