## Research Findings (5 Queries Completed)

### Research Query 1: PSFramework Integration Best Practices for PowerShell 5.1
**Key Findings**:
- **Installation**: PSFramework is a free PowerShell module with PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
- **Provider System**: Uses "providers" as pointers to logging destinations (filesystem, SQL, Graylog, etc.)
- **Automatic Management**: 7-day retention and 100MB size limits with automatic cleanup
- **Configuration System**: Provider information stored in PSFramework Configuration System
- **PowerShell 5.1 Issues**: Scheduled task logging requires special attention due to known issues
- **Best Practices**: Establish clear logging guidelines with informative and actionable logs

### Research Query 2: Claude Code CLI Output Monitoring and Parsing Techniques
**Key Findings**:
- **Monitoring Tools Available**: Multiple open-source tools for Claude Code usage monitoring
- **"RECOMMENDED:" Pattern**: Structured recommendation outputs used by automation tools
- **PowerShell Integration**: Direct Windows PowerShell integration possible via WSL wrapper functions
- **Hooks System**: Claude Code hooks for user-defined shell commands at lifecycle points
- **Headless Mode**: Non-interactive execution for automation with `-p` flag and `--output-format stream-json`
- **File Output**: Claude Code outputs to local JSONL files that can be monitored

### Research Query 3: Safe Automated Command Execution Patterns
**Key Findings**:
- **Runspace Isolation**: Isolated execution environments prevent interference between operations
- **Constrained Runspaces**: Security feature to restrict available commands for safety
- **Session State Management**: Control configuration of PowerShell sessions and modules
- **Built-in Security**: Execution policies and AMSI integration for malware protection
- **Runspace Pools**: Throttling and resource management for high-volume operations
- **Asynchronous Execution**: BeginInvoke() method for non-blocking operations

### Research Query 4: Git Integration for Automated Rollback Systems
**Key Findings**:
- **Git Hooks with PowerShell**: Pre-commit, commit-msg, post-commit hooks for automation
- **Rollback Commands**: `git reset` and `git revert` for different rollback scenarios
- **Safety Practices**: Create backup branches before rollbacks, implement monitoring
- **PowerShell Git Workflows**: Integration patterns for commit automation and validation
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message formats for automation
- **Automated Detection**: Monitor application health and trigger rollbacks based on thresholds

### Research Query 5: Performance Optimization for High-Volume Logging Scenarios
**Key Findings**:
- **Transaction Batching**: Collect log messages in memory and write in single database transaction
- **Array Optimization**: Use `[System.Collections.Generic.List[Object]]` instead of arrays for better performance
- **Caching Strategies**: Cache static data and avoid inefficient null output patterns
- **Pipeline vs Foreach**: Traditional foreach loops significantly faster than Foreach-Object (6-167x)
- **Native .NET Methods**: Direct .NET method calls outperform equivalent cmdlets
- **PowerShell 5.1 Specific**: Consider migration to PowerShell 7 for performance gains
