    Timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    ActionType TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'ErrorDetection', 'FixApplication', 'PatternLearning'
    ActionDescription TEXT NOT NULL,
    ModuleName TEXT NOT NULL,
    InputData TEXT,  -- JSON serialized input

**Response Processing Workflow**:
1. **FileSystemWatcher Monitoring**: Monitor Claude Code CLI output files
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Parse "RECOMMENDED: TYPE - details" patterns
3. **Command Validation**: Verify against whitelist, check execution policies
4. **Safe Execution**: Execute in isolated runspace with timeout
5. **Result Processing**: Capture output, format for re-submission
6. **Automatic Re-engagement**: Submit results back to Claude Code CLI

**Command Type Mapping**:
```powershell
$CommandMappings = @{
    'TEST' = @{
        Pattern = 'RECOMMENDED:\s*TEST\s*-\s*(.+)'
        Handler = 'Invoke-TestCommand'
        SafetyLevel = 'Medium'
        Timeout = 300 # seconds
    }
    'BUILD' = @{
        Pattern = 'RECOMMENDED:\s*BUILD\s*-\s*(.+)'
        Handler = 'Invoke-BuildCommand'
        SafetyLevel = 'High'
        Timeout = 600
    }
    'ANALYZE' = @{
        Pattern = 'RECOMMENDED:\s*ANALYZE\s*-\s*(.+)'
