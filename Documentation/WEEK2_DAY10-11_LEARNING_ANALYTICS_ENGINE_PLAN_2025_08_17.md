   - Identify high-performing patterns

2. **Learning Curve Analysis**
   - Trend calculations for improvement over time
   - Moving average calculations
   - Performance trajectory analysis
   - Identify learning plateaus

3. **Confidence Adjustment Algorithms**
   - Feedback-based confidence updates

   - Success/failure impact on future confidence
   - Dynamic threshold adjustment

4. **Pattern Optimization & Recommendation**
   - Effectiveness scoring algorithm
   - Pattern ranking by performance
   - Context-aware pattern recommendations
   - Similar pattern suggestions

## Research Findings (5 Queries Completed)

### 1. Moving Average Calculations in PowerShell
- Use Measure-Object with array slicing for window calculations
- Formula: `($array[$start..$end] | Measure-Object -Average).Average`
- Implement rolling windows for trend detection
- Track trends with up/down/stable indicators

### 2. Bayesian Confidence Updates
- Prior probability + new evidence = posterior probability
- Formula: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
- Update confidence based on success/failure outcomes
- Weight recent outcomes more heavily than old ones

### 3. Pattern Recommendation Algorithms
- Similarity-based ranking using Levenshtein distance
- Effectiveness scoring: success_rate * average_confidence
- Content-based filtering for similar patterns
- Collaborative filtering based on usage patterns

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) for ranking
- Precision@K for top-K recommendations
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for first relevant result
- Success rate tracking over time windows

### 5. Learning Curve Analysis
- Exponential smoothing for trend detection
- Calculate improvement rate over time periods
- Identify learning plateaus and breakthroughs
- Use moving averages to smooth noise
