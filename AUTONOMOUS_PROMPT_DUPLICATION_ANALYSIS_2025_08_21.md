# Autonomous Agent Prompt Duplication Analysis

**Problem**: Duplicated directive block in autonomous agent responses  
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Context**: Debugging autonomous agent response prompt system  
**Previous Context**: Working on ROADMAP_FEATURES_ANALYSIS_ARP_2025_08_20 implementation  
**Topics Involved**: Autonomous agent, prompt engineering, response processing  

## Summary Information

### Problem Description
The autonomous agent's automated response prompt contains a duplicated block between the "======..." sets, and the recommendation examples are being treated as literal text instead of examples.

### Project Home State
- **Project**: Unity-Claude Automation System
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 Parallel Processing Implementation (Week 1 completed)
- **Implementation Status**: Following ROADMAP_FEATURES_ANALYSIS_ARP_2025_08_20.md plan
- **Current Task**: Debugging autonomous agent response prompt duplication issue

### Project Code State and Structure
```
Unity-Claude-Automation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1 (Contains problematic directive)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt (Contains duplicate directive)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ClaudeResponses/Autonomous/ (Response files directory)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Modules/Unity-Claude-SystemStatus/ (System status modules)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ROADMAP_FEATURES_ANALYSIS_ARP_2025_08_20.md (Implementation plan)
```

### Long-Term Objectives
- Complete Phase 1: Parallel Processing with Runspace Pools (Weeks 1-4)
- Implement Phase 2: Email/Webhook Notifications (Weeks 5-6)
- Maintain autonomous agent operation for continuous improvement

### Short-Term Objectives
- Fix autonomous agent prompt duplication issue
- Ensure proper recommendation format examples vs. literal text
- Maintain autonomous monitoring functionality

### Current Implementation Plan
Following ROADMAP_FEATURES_ANALYSIS_ARP_2025_08_20.md:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 Week 1: Foundation & Thread Safety (COMPLETED)
- üîß Current: Debugging autonomous agent prompt issues
- ‚è≥ Next: Phase 1 Week 2: Runspace Pool Integration

### Benchmarks
- Autonomous agent should submit properly formatted prompts
- Recommendation format should be examples, not literal text
- No duplicate directive blocks in responses

### Current Blockers
1. **IDENTIFIED**: Duplicate directive blocks in autonomous agent prompts
2. **IDENTIFIED**: Recommendation examples treated as literal text

## Error Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location 1: Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1 (Lines 47-59)**
```powershell
$script:CriticalDirective = @"

==================================================
CRITICAL: AT THE END OF YOUR RESPONSE, YOU MUST CREATE A RESPONSE .JSON FILE AT ./ClaudeResponses/Autonomous/ AND IN IT WRITE THE END OF YOUR RESPONSE, WHICH SHOULD END WITH:
  [RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE]
  [RECOMMENDATION: TEST <Name>]
  [RECOMMENDATION: FIX <File>]
  [RECOMMENDATION: COMPILE]
  [RECOMMENDATION: RESTART <Module>]
  [RECOMMENDATION: COMPLETE]
  [RECOMMENDATION: ERROR <Description>]
==================================================
"@
```

**Location 2: CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt (Line 122)**
```
================================================== CRITICAL: AT THE END OF YOUR RESPONSE, YOU MUST CREATE A RESPONSE .JSON FILE AT ./ClaudeResponses/Autonomous/ AND IN IT WRITE THE END OF YOUR RESPONSE, WHICH SHOULD END WITH: [RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE]; [RECOMMENDATION: TEST <Name>]; [RECOMMENDATION: FIX <File>]; [RECOMMENDATION: COMPILE]; [RECOMMENDATION: RESTART <Module>]; [RECOMMENDATION: COMPLETE]; [RECOMMENDATION: ERROR <Description>]==================================================
```

**Problem Flow**:
1. Claude responds using CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt (contains directive)
2. Autonomous agent reads response and appends $script:CriticalDirective (Line 321)
3. Result: Double directive block in submitted prompt

### Issues Identified

1. **Duplication**: Directive appears in both source prompt file and autonomous agent script
2. **Format Issues**: 
   - File 1 uses multi-line format with bullet points
   - File 2 uses single-line format with semicolons
   - Examples should be illustrative, not literal inclusion

### Preliminary Solution
1. Remove duplication by eliminating directive from one location
2. Reformat directive to be example-based rather than literal inclusion
3. Ensure proper recommendation format in autonomous responses

## Implementation Plan

### Fix Strategy
1. **Remove duplication**: Keep directive in CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt only
2. **Update autonomous agent**: Remove $script:CriticalDirective appending
3. **Improve directive formatting**: Make examples clearer as examples
4. **Test autonomous loop**: Verify fix doesn't break response processing

### Detailed Fix Steps

#### Step 1: Update CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt
- Clarify that recommendation examples are examples, not literal text
- Improve formatting for better understanding

#### Step 2: Update Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1
- Remove $script:CriticalDirective variable definition (Lines 47-59)
- Remove directive appending in Process-ResponseFile function (Line 321)
- Ensure response text is submitted as-is from Claude

#### Step 3: Test Autonomous Loop
- Submit test response to verify no duplication
- Ensure recommendation format works correctly

## IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION ‚úÖ

### Changes Applied

#### 1. Fixed CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt
- **Lines 122-134**: Updated directive format to clearly show recommendation examples
- **Improvement**: Changed from literal brackets to proper example formats  
- **Added**: Concrete example as requested by user
- **Format**: Multi-line clear format with "choose the appropriate one" instruction

#### 2. Fixed Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1
- **Lines 46-47**: Added $script:SimpleDirective with one-line format
- **Lines 308-327**: Added RECOMMENDATION extraction logic
- **Line 324**: Create prompt with recommendation + simple directive
- **Result**: Autonomous agent now submits only recommendation line + directive

### Validation Required
- Test autonomous agent loop to ensure no duplicate directives
- Verify recommendation format works correctly
- Confirm autonomous monitoring continues to function

## Preliminary Solution Details

### Root Issue
The autonomous agent is double-appending the critical directive because:
1. Claude's response already contains the directive (from CLAUDE_PROMPT_DIRECTIVES_COMPLETE_UCA.txt)
2. The autonomous agent script adds it again (Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1)

### Correct Flow Should Be
1. Claude responds with proper recommendation format (built into prompt)
2. Autonomous agent submits response as-is (no additional directive needed)
3. Next Claude response follows same pattern

### Benefits of Fix
- Eliminates duplicate directives
- Maintains proper autonomous loop operation
- Clarifies recommendation format as examples
- Reduces prompt length and complexity
