## Research Findings (Queries 1-5)

### 1. iOS App Global Mode State Management Best Practices (2025)

#### Modern SwiftUI State Management Evolution
- **@Observable Pattern**: iOS 17+ introduces @Observable for cleaner global state management
- **Minimal Wrapper Principle**: Use simplest property wrapper (@State, @Environment, @Bindable) for needs
- **Environment for Global State**: @Environment preferred for app-wide settings like mode preferences
- **Avoid Global Singletons**: Dependency injection preferred over global variables for better modularity

#### State Scope Management
- **Smallest Scope Rule**: Always aim for smallest accessibility scope possible
- **Lifecycle Consideration**: Global state must handle app lifecycle transitions properly
- **Performance**: Large state variables can cause SwiftUI performance issues - keep mode state minimal
- **Mobile-Specific**: App developers must handle state save/restore across app termination

### 2. TCA Global State Patterns and App-Level Preferences

#### TCA Global State Architecture
- **Single Store Approach**: TCA encourages single store/state per application rather than multiple stores
- **Feature Composition**: Break complex functionalities into smaller, modular units that combine
- **State Composition**: Global state contains nested states of app features
- **Memory Management**: Not all features active simultaneously - TCA manages lifecycle automatically

#### App-Level Preferences in TCA
- **Global Accessibility**: App-level preferences (authentication, theme, mode) stored in global state
- **WithViewStore Optimization**: Performance wrapper for accessing relevant state portions
- **Unidirectional Flow**: Mode changes flow through actions and reducers consistently
- **Cleanup Automation**: SwiftUI bindings and TCA handle state cleanup automatically

### 3. SwiftUI Conditional UI Performance for Mode-Based Interfaces

#### Conditional Rendering Optimization
- **Ternary Operators**: Most efficient for simple conditional modifiers and styling
- **View Identity**: Proper conditional patterns prevent unnecessary view recreation
- **Layout Recalculation**: Minimize state changes and combine modifiers for performance
- **Extension Organization**: Use extensions for conditional logic clarity and reusability

#### Background and Headless Optimization
- **Background Task Scheduler**: System manages execution based on battery and processing availability
- **Resource Minimization**: Avoid unnecessary hardware usage (GPS, accelerometer) in headless mode
- **Scene Phase**: Base UI logic on scenePhase value for proper background transitions
- **Lazy Loading**: Use lazy stacks for large view lists to enhance performance

### 4. iOS UserDefaults vs SwiftData for Simple App Preferences

#### UserDefaults Advantages for Simple Preferences
- **Perfect for Simple Data**: User preferences, settings, app state across launches
- **@AppStorage Integration**: SwiftUI @AppStorage provides automatic UserDefaults binding
- **Performance**: Lightweight for small data (<512KB recommended by Apple)
- **Instant Access**: Automatically loaded at app launch for immediate availability

#### SwiftData vs UserDefaults Decision Matrix
- **UserDefaults**: Simple key-value pairs (mode preference, settings, flags)
- **SwiftData**: Complex data with relationships, advanced querying, sophisticated modeling
- **Performance**: UserDefaults for small data, SwiftData for complex persistence
- **Integration**: @AppStorage perfect for SwiftUI reactive mode preferences

#### Best Practice Recommendation
- **Mode Preferences**: Use @AppStorage with UserDefaults for mode persistence
- **Complex Data**: Reserve SwiftData for response/template storage (already implemented)
- **Mixed Approach**: UserDefaults for preferences, SwiftData for application data

### 5. iOS Background Processing and Headless Mode Optimization

#### Background Execution Capabilities
- **Background Processing Mode**: Xcode capability for maintenance tasks (database cleanup, ML training)
- **System Scheduling**: Background execution managed by battery level, low power mode, user settings
- **Task Management**: Use beginBackgroundTask/endBackgroundTask for proper lifecycle
- **Resource Constraints**: Background execution limited by system conditions and user preferences

#### Headless Mode Implementation Patterns
- **WKWebView Patterns**: Zero-size frame for background web processing
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimize data usage, power consumption, unnecessary hardware access
- **Cross-Platform**: Headless implementations support app-termination survival
- **Testing**: Use Xcode's background simulation for proper testing
