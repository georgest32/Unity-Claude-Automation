## Current Implementation Plan Status

### Dependencies Analysis
**Required for Day 11 Implementation**:
- ✅ **SafeExecution.psm1**: Security framework for command execution
- ✅ **AgentLogging.psm1**: Comprehensive logging infrastructure
- ✅ **ConversationStateManager.psm1**: State tracking for error context
- ✅ **AgentCore.psm1**: Configuration and state management

**Integration Points for Error Handling**:
- Response processing → Error detection and classification
- Command execution → Retry and fallback mechanisms  
- Conversation management → Error context preservation
- Safety framework → Secure error recovery operations

**Compatibility Considerations**:
- PowerShell 5.1 syntax patterns (all modules validated)
- ASCII-only characters (Learning #16)
- Thread-safe logging (mutex-based)
- Module loading architecture (12 nested modules working)

## Research Findings (5 queries completed)

### 1. Exponential Backoff Retry Strategy Best Practices
**Core Principles**: Exponentially increase delay between retries (base * 2^n), limit retry attempts, cap maximum backoff time
**Jitter Implementation**: Add randomness to prevent thundering herd problems when multiple clients retry simultaneously
**Error Type Consideration**: Not all errors worth retrying - distinguish transient (network timeouts) vs permanent (authentication failures)
**Integration**: Works with circuit breakers to prevent retry storms during persistent failures

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern for Persistent Failures
**Three States**: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-Open (testing recovery)
**Timeout Handling**: Time-boxing requests with finite limits, interpret timeouts as failures
**Failure Classification**: Distinguish transient vs persistent failures - only retry former
**Monitoring**: Track average response time, error rate, latency percentiles for dynamic adjustment

### 3. Selective Retry Logic Based on Error Classification
**Retryable Errors**: HTTP 408, 429, 5xx codes, network timeouts, temporary service unavailability
**Non-retryable Errors**: 401 (unauthorized), 4xx client errors, authentication failures, invalid requests
**Context-aware Classification**: Consider both HTTP status codes and error message content
**Intelligent Strategy**: Inventory specific errors and classify as retryable vs non-retryable

### 4. PowerShell Timeout and Cancellation Limitations
**Current State**: PowerShell lacks built-in CancellationToken support for common parameters
**Active Development**: GitHub proposals for CancellationToken support and PipelineStopToken
**Workarounds**: Use AsyncWaitHandle.WaitOne() for polling with timeout, manual cancellation logic
**Future Support**: Proposed $CancellationToken variable and $CancellationActionPreference

### 5. Safe Mode Operations and Failure Mode Management
**Safe Mode Concept**: Reduced functionality diagnostic mode with only essential components loaded
**Emergency Recovery**: Root privilege with full file system access for troubleshooting
**Failure Mode Analysis**: Focus on software requirements, design, code, interfaces - not black box approach
**Automated Escalation**: Technology and pre-defined rules for issue routing based on SLA violations

## Granular Implementation Plan - Day 11 Error Handling and Retry Logic

### Morning (3 hours): Robust Error Recovery Implementation

#### Hour 1: Create ErrorHandling.psm1 Module
1. **Exponential Backoff Implementation**: Create retry strategies with base delay, max attempts, jitter
2. **Error Classification Engine**: Distinguish transient vs permanent errors for selective retry
3. **PowerShell 5.1 Compatible**: Use AsyncWaitHandle.WaitOne() for timeout handling (no CancellationToken)
4. **Integration**: Connect with existing SafeExecution and AgentLogging modules

#### Hour 2: Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation  
1. **Three-State Management**: Closed, Open, Half-Open state machine
2. **Failure Threshold Detection**: Monitor error rates and response times
3. **Timeout Handling**: Time-boxing with finite limits for operation safety
4. **Integration**: Works with retry logic to prevent retry storms

#### Hour 3: Timeout and Cancellation Support
1. **Manual Timeout Logic**: Implement PowerShell-compatible timeout using System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch
2. **Operation Cancellation**: Graceful cancellation mechanisms for long-running operations
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper resource disposal on timeout/cancellation
4. **Thread Safety**: Coordinate with existing mutex-based logging

### Afternoon (2-3 hours): Failure Mode Management Implementation

#### Hour 4: Human Escalation and Notification System
1. **Escalation Triggers**: SLA violation detection, persistent failure patterns
2. **Notification Mechanisms**: File-based alerts, log-based notifications
3. **Escalation Matrix**: Hierarchical escalation based on error severity
4. **Integration**: Connect with conversation state management for context

#### Hour 5: Safe Mode Operations for Critical Failures
1. **Minimal Operation Mode**: Reduced functionality when critical systems fail
2. **Emergency Recovery**: Essential operations only (logging, basic file operations)
3. **Failure Isolation**: Prevent cascading failures through containment
4. **Recovery Coordination**: Integration with checkpoint and rollback systems

#### Hour 6: Recovery Checkpoint and Rollback Mechanisms
1. **State Checkpointing**: Periodic state saves for recovery points
2. **Rollback Implementation**: Restore to last known good state
3. **Diagnostic Data Collection**: Comprehensive error logging and analysis
4. **Recovery Validation**: Verify system integrity after recovery operations

### Integration Requirements
- **SafeExecution Module**: Use constrained runspace for safe error recovery operations
- **AgentLogging Module**: Enhanced error logging with retry attempt tracking
- **ConversationStateManager**: Preserve error context across recovery attempts
- **ContextOptimization**: Maintain context during error scenarios

### Success Criteria
