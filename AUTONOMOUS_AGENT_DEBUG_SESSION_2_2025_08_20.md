# Autonomous Agent Debugging Session 2
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Time**: 12:07 PM
**Context**: Follow-up debugging after previous fixes were not effective
**Previous Session**: AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_DEBUG_ANALYSIS_2025_08_20.md (11:53 AM)

## Problem Summary

The autonomous agent is still experiencing the same critical issues despite previous fixes:

1. **Window Detection Still Wrong** - Still targeting "Administrator: Windows PowerShell (PID: 5804)" instead of "Claude Code CLI environment" 
2. **GetCurrentThreadId DLL Error** - Function not found in user32.dll (should be kernel32.dll)
3. **TerminalWindowHandle Lost Again** - system_status.json no longer contains window handle information
4. **Window Title Consistency** - User requests ensuring window title matches tab title

## Current System State

### Project Context  
- **Current Focus**: Phase 4 Advanced Features (95% success rate)
- **Project**: Unity-Claude Automation 
- **Environment**: PowerShell 5.1, Unity 2021.1.14f1
- **Status**: Autonomous agent partially functional but window automation failing

### Critical Console Evidence
```
[CLISubmission] Found Claude terminal: Administrator: Windows PowerShell (PID: 5804)
[CLISubmission] Target window: Administrator: Windows PowerShell
[CLISubmission] Error submitting prompt: Exception calling "GetCurrentThreadId" with "0" argument(s): "Unable to find an entry point named 'GetCurrentThreadId' in DLL 'user32.dll'."
[CLISubmission] CLI submission completed: False
```

### System Status Analysis
Current system_status.json shows:
```json
"ClaudeCodeCLI": {
    "ProcessId": 36760,
    "Status": "Active", 
    "DetectionMethod": "Node.js Process",
    "LastDetected": "2025-08-20 12:07:24.577"
}
```

**Missing Fields**: TerminalWindowHandle, TerminalProcessId, WindowTitle - all gone!

### Window Detection Log Evidence  
window_detection.log consistently shows wrong window selection:
```
[2025-08-20 12:06:24] Selected window: Administrator: Windows PowerShell (PID: 5804)
[2025-08-20 12:06:54] Selected window: Administrator: Windows PowerShell (PID: 5804)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Previous Fixes Not Persistent
**Problem**: The TerminalWindowHandle information added in previous session was removed
**Root Cause**: Update-ClaudeCodePID.ps1 likely ran again and overwrote the data
**Evidence**: system_status.json only has basic Node.js process info, not terminal window handle

### Issue 2: GetCurrentThreadId DLL Location Error
**Problem**: CLISubmission module declares GetCurrentThreadId in user32.dll
**Root Cause**: GetCurrentThreadId is actually in kernel32.dll, not user32.dll  
**Evidence**: Exception message shows "Unable to find an entry point named 'GetCurrentThreadId' in DLL 'user32.dll'"

### Issue 3: CLISubmission Module Not Using TerminalWindowHandle
**Problem**: Even when TerminalWindowHandle exists, CLISubmission doesn't prioritize it
**Root Cause**: Module logic may not be checking TerminalWindowHandle field first
**Evidence**: Console shows traditional PID-based window detection instead of handle-based

### Issue 4: Window Title Synchronization
**Problem**: Need to ensure window title matches tab title "Claude Code CLI environment"
**User Request**: "is there a way to make sure the window title is also Claude Code CLI environment?"

## Implementation Plan Status
Based on previous AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_DEBUG_ANALYSIS_2025_08_20.md, fixes were supposed to be applied but appear ineffective:

- ❌ Update-ClaudeCodePID.ps1: TerminalWindowHandle preservation (reverted)
- ❌ CLISubmission module: Priority window handle detection (not working) 
- ❌ GetCurrentThreadId DLL location (still wrong)
- ❌ Window title consistency (not maintained)

## Research Findings (4 Web Queries)

### Query 1: GetCurrentThreadId DLL Location
**Problem**: GetCurrentThreadId declared in user32.dll causing "entry point not found" error
**Research Result**: GetCurrentThreadId is located in kernel32.dll, not user32.dll
**Solution**: Move DllImport from user32.dll to kernel32.dll in CLISubmission module
**Impact**: Fixes "Unable to find entry point" error

### Query 2: Add-Member Properties Lost in JSON Round Trips
**Problem**: Properties added with Add-Member disappear after ConvertTo-Json/ConvertFrom-Json
**Research Result**: Known PowerShell issue - "ConvertTo-Json does not convert additional members of nested properties"
**Root Cause**: ETS properties on nested objects not serialized properly
**Solution**: Use proper -Depth parameter and avoid Add-Member on nested properties

### Query 3: Add-Type "Type Already Exists" Error  
**Problem**: Multiple module loads cause "type already exists" errors
**Research Result**: .NET limitation - can't unload types once loaded
**Solution**: Check if type exists before loading using PSTypeName or ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
**Impact**: Prevents Add-Type failures in CLISubmission module

### Query 4: Hashtable vs PSCustomObject for JSON
**Problem**: Understanding why properties are lost during JSON operations
**Research Result**: PSCustomObject preferred for JSON, hashtables for key-value lists
**Solution**: Use [PSCustomObject] for structured data that needs JSON persistence
**Impact**: Better understanding of JSON serialization behavior

## PID Marker File Analysis

Found .claude_code_cli_pid file contents:
```
5.1.22621.5697
14328
Claude Code CLI Terminal (Verified)  
C:\Program Files\Git\bin\..\usr\bin\bash.exe
```

**Problem**: PID 14328 doesn't match current Claude Code CLI process (36760)
**Impact**: CLISubmission using stale PID marker leading to wrong window detection

## Root Cause: JSON Property Loss Mechanism

The core issue is that our approach of using Add-Member on nested JSON objects doesn't persist across ConvertTo-Json round trips. When Update-ClaudeCodePID.ps1 runs, it:

1. Reads system_status.json with ConvertFrom-Json
2. Modifies the ClaudeCodeCLI object (overwrites entire object)
3. Saves with ConvertTo-Json 
4. **Loses all Add-Member properties** in the process

## Comprehensive Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Robust JSON Property Management (30 minutes)
1. **Modify Update-ClaudeCodePID.ps1** - Use proper nested object preservation instead of Add-Member
2. **Fix GetCurrentThreadId DLL** - Move from user32.dll to kernel32.dll  
3. **Update PID marker file** - Write current correct PID

### Phase 2: Enhanced Window Detection (20 minutes)  
4. **Restore window handle info** - Re-run Set-ClaudeCodeWindow.ps1
5. **Test CLISubmission priority** - Verify TerminalWindowHandle usage
6. **Add Add-Type existence checks** - Prevent type already exists errors

### Phase 3: Window Title Consistency (10 minutes)
7. **Set PowerShell window title** - $host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = "Claude Code CLI environment"
8. **Test title persistence** - Verify title matches tab

### Phase 4: End-to-End Validation (10 minutes)
9. **Test autonomous agent** - Verify correct window targeting
10. **Validate prompt submission** - Ensure CLI submission returns True

## Files Requiring Attention
- Update-ClaudeCodePID.ps1 (nested object preservation)
- Unity-Claude-CLISubmission.psm1 (DLL fix + Add-Type check)
- .claude_code_cli_pid (update with correct PID)  
- system_status.json (restore window handle info)

## Expected Outcome
- Autonomous agent targets correct "Claude Code CLI environment" window  
- CLI submission returns True instead of False
- Properties persist across JSON operations
- Window title matches tab title consistently
