## Research Findings (5 Queries Completed)

### Research Query Results:

**Query 1: PowerShell Module Integration Testing Best Practices**
- **Primary Framework**: Pester is the standard for PowerShell integration testing
- **Cross-Module Dependencies**: Use `-ModuleName` parameter for module-specific mocking
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions with PowerShell 7 and automated Pester testing
- **Dependency Management**: PSDepend for build environment dependency management
- **Critical Learning**: Module state isolation requires special attention for internal function testing

**Query 2: FileSystemWatcher Performance Testing Methodologies**
- **Performance Challenge**: PowerShell can miss change events during lengthy operations (5+ second processing)
- **Reliability Issue**: Synchronous FileSystemWatcher has blind spots during WaitForChanged() processing
- **Stress Testing**: Use Start-Job for parallel execution to simulate simultaneous file operations
- **Best Practice**: Implement try...finally blocks for proper FileSystemWatcher disposal
- **Critical Learning**: Single-threaded nature requires timeouts to maintain responsiveness

**Query 3: Constrained Runspace Security Stress Testing**
- **Security Framework**: Constrained Language Mode prevents native API access and .NET calls
