### Research Requirements:
Need to research modern iOS UI polish techniques, SwiftUI animation best practices, Core Haptics implementation, iPad optimization strategies, and onboarding UX patterns.

## Research Findings

### 1. SwiftUI Animations & Transitions (2025 Best Practices)
**Research Completed**: Modern iOS animation techniques for 60+ FPS performance

**Key Findings**:
- **Performance Target**: 16ms frame render time for 60 FPS, 120 FPS on ProMotion displays
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-accelerated transforms and opacity over CPU-bound recalculations
- **New iOS 18 Features**: KeyframeAnimator for timeline-based complex animation sequences
- **Optimization**: Use withAnimation() for batch operations, avoid .animation(_:) on many views
- **Spring Animations**: Natural physical movement with damping ratio and velocity parameters
- **Performance Tools**: Instruments 26 with SwiftUI instrument and Cause & Effect Graph

**Implementation Pattern**:
```swift
withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.7)) {
    // State changes with optimized spring animation
}
```

### 2. Core Haptics Framework & Haptic Feedback
**Research Completed**: iOS haptic feedback implementation and UX best practices

**Key Findings**:
- **UIFeedbackGenerator**: Simple haptic feedback for basic interactions (.success, .warning, .error)
- **Core Haptics**: Advanced patterns with CHHapticEngine for custom experiences
- **UX Hierarchy**: Heavier haptics for important actions, lighter for minor interactions
- **Performance**: Call prepare() before triggering to avoid delays
- **User Control**: Always provide settings to disable haptics
- **Device Compatibility**: Not all devices support haptics, requires capability checking

**Best Practices**:
- Use success haptic for successful operations
- Use warning haptic for validation failures
- Use error haptic for critical failures
- Pair with visual animations for enhanced feedback

### 3. Loading States & Onboarding Flows
**Research Completed**: Modern loading UX and onboarding patterns

**Key Findings**:
- **Skeleton Screens**: Custom .skeleton() modifier preferred over .redacted() for consistency
- **Shimmer Effects**: Reduce perceived loading time with visual movement
- **Onboarding Patterns**: TabView for swipeable experiences, interactive elements for engagement
- **AHA Moment**: Get users to value realization as quickly as possible
- **Short & Sweet**: Keep onboarding under few minutes, focus on critical features
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Use @Published properties and ObservableObject for state management

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Custom skeleton loading with shimmer animation
- Interactive onboarding with TabView and PageControl
- Feature discovery with progressive disclosure
- Quick value demonstration

### 4. iPad Optimization & Split View
**Research Completed**: iPad-specific UX patterns and adaptive layouts

**Key Findings**:
- **Split View Enhancement**: Automatic column management in SwiftUI 2025
- **Size Classes**: @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) for adaptive layouts
- **ViewThatFits**: Automatic layout selection for responsive design
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: iPadOS 26 menu bar integration with commands API
- **Multi-Selection**: Shift/Command shortcuts without edit mode requirement
- **Windowing**: Fluid resize support with truly adaptive layouts

**Technical Requirements**:
- Regular width/height size classes for iPad
- Multi-selection with keyboard support
- Context menus for iPad interactions
- Responsive design avoiding UIScreen.main.bounds

### 5. Settings Interface & Data Management
**Research Completed**: User preferences and backup/restore capabilities

**Key Findings**:
- **Theme Architecture**: Protocol-based ThemeManager with @Published properties
- **MVVM Patterns**: Separation of business logic from UI with native SwiftUI binding
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global resource management for user preferences
- **CloudKit Integration**: SwiftData with iCloud sync for automatic backup/restore
- **Data Requirements**: Optional properties, no @Attribute(.unique) for CloudKit sync
- **Privacy**: Encrypted fields in CloudKit for data protection

**Implementation Approach**:
- ThemeManager as ObservableObject with @EnvironmentObject
- Settings persistence with UserDefaults and CloudKit
- Automatic backup/restore with SwiftData iCloud sync
