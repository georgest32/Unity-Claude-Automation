## Week 3 Day 1 Implementation Plan

### Monday Morning (4 hours): Performance Cache Module
**Target File**: `Modules/Unity-Claude-CPG/Core/Performance-Cache.psm1`

#### Objectives:
1. Implement Redis-like in-memory cache
2. Add cache warming strategies
3. Create cache preloading
4. Build cache metrics

#### Key Features to Implement:
- Fast key-value storage with O(1) access
- TTL (Time-To-Live) support
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
- Cache statistics and monitoring
- Thread-safe operations
- Memory management

### Monday Afternoon (4 hours): Parallel Processing Module  
**Target File**: `Modules/Unity-Claude-CPG/Core/Performance-ParallelProcessor.psm1`

#### Objectives:
1. Implement runspace pools
2. Add parallel file processing
3. Create work distribution logic
4. Build progress tracking

#### Key Features to Implement:
- Configurable runspace pool size
- Work queue management
- Result aggregation
- Error handling in parallel contexts
- Progress reporting
- Resource cleanup

## Implementation Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for repeated queries
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for 10,000 cached items
- **Parallel Processing**: 4-8x speedup on multi-core systems
- **File Processing**: Target 100+ files/second

### Dependencies
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- System.Collections.Concurrent for thread-safe collections
- System.Management.Automation.Runspaces for parallel processing

## Research Requirements

### Research Topics for Implementation:
1. PowerShell synchronized hashtable best practices
2. Memory-efficient caching strategies in PowerShell
3. Runspace pool optimization techniques
4. Work distribution algorithms
5. Cache warming patterns
6. LRU implementation in PowerShell
7. Performance monitoring in PowerShell
8. Thread-safe collection patterns

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Memory Management**: Cache growth could impact system memory
2. **Runspace Overhead**: Too many runspaces could degrade performance
3. **Thread Safety**: Complex synchronization requirements
4. **Error Propagation**: Handling errors across parallel executions

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Implement configurable cache size limits
2. Dynamic runspace pool sizing based on system resources
3. Use proven synchronization patterns from existing modules
4. Comprehensive error aggregation and reporting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Monday Morning):
1. Create Performance-Cache.psm1 module structure
2. Implement core cache storage with synchronized hashtable
3. Add TTL management system
4. Create cache warming infrastructure
5. Build comprehensive cache metrics

### Afternoon Actions:
1. Create Performance-ParallelProcessor.psm1 module
2. Implement runspace pool management
3. Build work distribution system
4. Add progress tracking
5. Create result aggregation

## Success Criteria

### Monday Deliverables:
- ✅ Performance-Cache.psm1 fully implemented
- ✅ Redis-like operations working
- ✅ Cache warming functional
- ✅ Performance-ParallelProcessor.psm1 created
- ✅ Runspace pools operational
- ✅ Parallel file processing working
- ✅ All tests passing

## Testing Strategy

### Cache Module Tests:
1. Basic CRUD operations
2. TTL expiration validation
3. LRU eviction verification
4. Thread safety stress test
5. Memory usage monitoring

### Parallel Processing Tests:
1. Work distribution validation
2. Result aggregation accuracy
3. Error handling verification
4. Performance benchmarking
5. Resource cleanup validation
