- [ ] **Mutex Permissions**: Proper mutex permissions prevent unauthorized access

## Safety Measures
- [ ] **Graceful Failure**: All functions fail gracefully without system impact
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: All resources properly disposed and cleaned up
- [ ] **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert to previous SystemStatus version
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: System continues to function even if logging features fail

# 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

## Pre-Deployment
1. **Backup Current System**: Create backup of existing Unity-Claude-SystemStatus module
2. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure .NET Framework 4.8 and PowerShell 5.1 available
3. **Review Configuration**: Plan logging and performance monitoring configuration
4. **Schedule Maintenance Window**: Plan deployment during low-usage period

## Deployment Process
1. **Stop SystemStatus Services**: Gracefully stop all SystemStatus-dependent processes
2. **Deploy Module Files**: Replace Unity-Claude-SystemStatus module with v1.1.0
3. **Update Configuration**: Apply new logging and performance configuration options
4. **Restart Services**: Restart SystemStatus services with new module
5. **Validate Operation**: Confirm all subsystems register and operate correctly

## Post-Deployment Validation
1. **Function Availability**: Verify all 41+ functions are available and exported
2. **Configuration Loading**: Confirm enhanced configuration loads correctly
3. **Logging Operation**: Validate enhanced logging writes to files correctly
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Test performance counter collection if enabled
5. **Diagnostic Capabilities**: Verify diagnostic mode and trace logging functionality

# 📋 Rollback Procedures

## Rollback Triggers
- Critical functionality failure during deployment
- Performance degradation >10% compared to baseline
- Configuration loading failures preventing system startup
- Test suite success rate <80%

## Rollback Steps
1. **Stop SystemStatus Services**: Gracefully stop all related processes
2. **Restore Module Backup**: Replace v1.1.0 with backed-up previous version
3. **Restore Configuration**: Revert to previous configuration files
4. **Restart Services**: Restart with previous module version
5. **Validate Rollback**: Confirm system returns to previous operational state
