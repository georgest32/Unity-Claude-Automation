# iOS Build Fixes for Codemagic
**Date**: 2025-09-03
**Platform**: Codemagic CI/CD
**Target**: AgentDashboard iOS App

## Fixes Applied (Ready for Codemagic Build)

### ✅ Swift 6 Sendable Conformance Fixed
- Added `Sendable` to all `@Reducer` structs
- Added `Sendable` to all `State` structs
- Fixed async/await capture issues

### ✅ TCA DependencyKey Issues Resolved
- Made `testValue` public and computed property in `APIClient`
- Fixed protocol conformance requirements

### ✅ Perception Tracking Added
- Updated `ModeAwareDashboard` with `WithPerceptionTracking`
- Fixed store.state access patterns for iOS 16 compatibility

### ✅ Missing Models Created
- Created `SystemStatus.swift` with complete implementation
- Added proper `Sendable` conformance to all models

### ✅ Public API Visibility Fixed
- Made `Action` enums public in all features
- Added public `init()` methods where needed
- Fixed public property access

## Files Modified for Codemagic Build
1. `APIClient.swift` - DependencyKey testValue
2. `AgentsFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance  
3. `AppFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
4. `DashboardFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
5. `TerminalFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
6. `ModeManagementFeature.swift` - Public API + Sendable
7. `ModeAwareDashboard.swift` - WithPerceptionTracking
8. `AgentDashboardApp.swift` - Store scoping
9. `SystemStatus.swift` - New model file (created)

## Expected Build Results

### Should Fix These Errors:
- ✅ `SwiftCompile normal arm64` compilation failures
- ✅ Actor-isolated property errors
- ✅ Non-sendable type capture errors
- ✅ Missing testValue protocol requirements
- ✅ WithPerceptionTracking warnings

### Build Should Now Succeed:
- All Swift 6 strict concurrency issues resolved
- All TCA 1.22+ compatibility issues addressed
- All missing dependencies and models created
- Proper iOS 16+ perception tracking implemented

## Recommended Codemagic Configuration

```yaml
# In codemagic.yaml
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    name: iOS AgentDashboard
    environment:
      xcode: 15.4 # or latest
      cocoapods: default
    scripts:
      - name: Build iOS app
        script: |
          xcodebuild -workspace AgentDashboard.xcworkspace \
                     -scheme AgentDashboard \
                     -sdk iphonesimulator \
                     -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
                     build
```

## Next Steps
1. **Commit all changes** to your repository
2. **Trigger Codemagic build** - should now pass
3. **Monitor for any remaining warnings** - may need minor tweaks
4. **Deploy if build succeeds**

## If Build Still Fails
- Check Codemagic logs for specific Swift 6 warnings
- May need to adjust Xcode version in Codemagic settings
- Verify all package dependencies are compatible with Swift 6
