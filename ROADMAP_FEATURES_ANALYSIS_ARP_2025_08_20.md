## üî¨ Research Findings (First 5 Queries - Parallel Processing)

### PowerShell Runspace Pool Research Summary
**Queries Completed**: 5/40 (PowerShell runspace pools focus)
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **Performance Hierarchy (2025)**:
   - ForEach-Object -Parallel: Fastest (0.79s for 20 items) - PowerShell 7+
   - Start-ThreadJob: Fast (2.37s for 20 items) - Cross-version compatibility
   - Runspace Pools: Fast + Maximum control
   - PSJobs: Slowest (7s with 2s overhead)

2. **PowerShell 5.1 Compatibility**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
   - System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool fully supported
   - Requires .NET Framework 4.5+ (available in PS 5.1)
   - Thread-safe collections require PowerShell 4.0+ (ConcurrentDictionary)

3. **Thread Safety Patterns**:
   - Synchronized Hashtables: `[hashtable]::Synchronized(@{})`
   - System.Collections.Concurrent classes for high performance
   - Manual locking with System.Threading.Monitor required for enumeration
   - Variable sharing via SessionStateProxy.SetVariable()

4. **Session State Configuration**:
   - InitialSessionState.CreateDefault() for proper language mode
   - Pre-load modules and variables for all runspaces
   - SessionStateVariableEntry for variable sharing
   - ApartmentState and ThreadOptions configuration

5. **Best Practices Identified**:
   - Default runspace pool size: 5 (optimal for most scenarios)
   - Use throttling to control resource usage
   - Consider ConcurrentBag for thread-safe result collection
   - Extensive testing required for thread synchronization

### Implementation Implications for Unity-Claude System
- **High Compatibility**: PowerShell 5.1 support confirmed
- **Performance Gain**: 75-93% improvement expected over sequential processing
- **Architecture Fit**: Ideal for Unity compilation + Claude submission + response processing
- **Complexity**: Medium-High due to thread safety requirements

## üî¨ Research Findings (Queries 6-10 - Email/Webhook/Event Log)

### Runspace Pool Error Handling & Concurrent Collections
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **Error Handling Patterns**:
   - Try/Catch/Finally with terminating vs non-terminating errors
   - BeginInvoke/EndInvoke error retrieval from runspaces
   - Resource disposal critical to prevent memory leaks
   - State management errors ("runspace pool not in 'Opened' state")

2. **Concurrent Collections (.NET 4.5)**:
   - ConcurrentQueue: Thread-safe FIFO operations, TryDequeue() patterns
   - ConcurrentBag: Unordered collection, better performance than Queue when order not important
   - Available in PowerShell 5.1 (.NET Framework 4.5)
   - Producer-Consumer patterns well supported

### Email Notifications Research
**Critical Security Finding**: üö® **Send-MailMessage is DEPRECATED**
- Officially obsolete in PowerShell 7.0+ due to security concerns
- Cannot guarantee secure connections to SMTP servers
- Microsoft recommends MailKit library or Microsoft Graph API
- Office 365 blocks SMTP AUTH by default (Security Defaults)

**Modern Alternatives**:
- **MailKit**: Full MIME/SMTP support, regular security updates
- **Send-MgUserMail**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
- **System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient**: Still functional but not recommended

### Webhook Integration Research
**Implementation Approach**: ‚úÖ STRAIGHTFORWARD
- Invoke-RestMethod with HTTP POST for webhook delivery
- JSON payload construction: `$payload | ConvertTo-Json`
- Multiple authentication methods supported:
  - Bearer Token (most common)
  - Basic Authentication (Base64 encoded)
  - API Keys in headers
  - OAuth (PowerShell 6+)

**Security Requirements**:
- HTTPS required for credential transmission
- Webhook URLs contain security tokens (privacy-dependent)
- Content-Type headers critical for JSON payloads

### Windows Event Log Integration Research
**PowerShell Version Compatibility**:
- **Get-EventLog**: PowerShell 5.1 only (classic logs)
- **Get-WinEvent**: PowerShell 5.1 + 7+ (modern + classic logs)
- **Write-EventLog**: Requires Administrator rights
- **PowerShell 7**: Import compatibility module for classic cmdlets

**Custom Event Source Creation**:
- New-EventLog cmdlet for custom log creation
- Requires Administrator privileges
- Event source registration required before writing
- Custom event IDs and structured logging supported

**Performance Considerations**:
- XPath queries vs Where-Object filtering (significant performance difference)
- Remote computer access supported
- Structured filtering reduces data transfer overhead

## üî¨ Research Findings (Queries 11-15 - GitHub Integration)

### GitHub API Integration Research
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **Authentication Methods (2025)**:
   - **Bearer Token** (Recommended): `Authorization: Bearer $token`
   - **Basic Authentication**: Base64 encoded PAT with username
   - **Microsoft PowerShellForGitHub Module**: Secure SecureString storage
   - **Environment Variables**: Best practice for token storage

2. **Issue Creation & Management**:
   - Direct REST API: `Invoke-RestMethod` with JSON payload
   - Microsoft PowerShellForGitHub module: Full pipeline support
   - Bulk creation: 30-40 issues in <10 seconds
   - Advanced search API: Recently enhanced (2025)

3. **Secure Token Storage**:
   - **PowerShellForGitHub**: `Set-GitHubAuthentication` with SecureString
   - **Manual**: Environment variables with `$env:GH_TOKEN`
   - **Warning**: PATs require same security as passwords
   - **Best Practice**: Encrypted storage for CI/CD scenarios

4. **Rate Limiting & Retry Logic**:
   - **Primary Limits**: 5,000 requests/hour (authenticated)
   - **Key Headers**: `x-ratelimit-remaining`, `x-ratelimit-reset`, `retry-after`
   - **Exponential Backoff**: Essential with jitter for distributed systems
   - **Proactive Monitoring**: Check rate before requests

5. **Issue Deduplication**:
   - **GitHub Search API**: PowerShell modules available (PSGithubSearch)
   - **Recent Features**: "Close as duplicate" API support (2024)
   - **Automation**: PowerShellForGitHub module simplifies workflows
   - **Search Integration**: Advanced search API with GraphQL support

### Implementation Implications for Unity-Claude System
- **High Feasibility**: Well-established PowerShell patterns
- **Security**: Secure token management available
- **Performance**: Rate limiting requires careful implementation
- **Deduplication**: Essential for autonomous error reporting
