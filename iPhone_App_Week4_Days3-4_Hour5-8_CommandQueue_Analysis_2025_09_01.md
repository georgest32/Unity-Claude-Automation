# iPhone App Week 4 Days 3-4 Hour 5-8: Command Queue Implementation Analysis

## Document Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-01
- **Time**: Current Session
- **Problem**: Implement command queue system for AI prompt submissions with priority, cancellation, and progress tracking
- **Context**: Phase 2 Week 4 Days 3-4 Hour 5-8 following completed prompt submission UI (Hour 1-4)
- **Topics**: Command Queue, TCA Effects, Async/Await, Priority Queue, Progress Tracking, Cancellation
- **Lineage**: Following iPhone_App_ARP_Master_Document_2025_08_31.md implementation plan

## Previous Context Summary

### âœ… Completed Hour 1-4: Prompt Submission UI
- **PromptFeature.swift**: Complete TCA implementation with prompt composition, system selection, enhancement options
- **PromptSubmissionView.swift**: Multi-line editor, AI system picker, mode selection, enhancement controls
- **Models.swift**: Command, CommandStatus, CommandSource structures for basic command handling
- **Foundation**: Basic prompt submission to AI systems with validation and error handling

### ðŸŽ¯ Hour 5-8 Objectives: Implement Command Queue
**Requirements from Implementation Plan**:
- **Hour 5-6**: Queue management with priority and FIFO ordering
- **Hour 7-8**: Cancellation support and progress tracking
- **Integration**: Command queue connects with existing PromptFeature and terminal system

## Research Findings

### 1. TCA and Async Operations (2025)
- **Modern Concurrency**: TCA now fully supports Swift's structured concurrency with async/await
- **Effects System**: Effects can be constructed using structured concurrency instead of Combine publishers
- **Lifecycle Management**: Effect lifetimes can be tied to view lifetimes through TCA's integration
- **Testability**: All async operations remain 100% testable through TestStore

### 2. Swift Command Queue Patterns
- **FIFO Ordering**: Dispatch queues manage tasks in First-In-First-Out order by default
- **Priority Systems**: Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide priority control (.userInteractive, .userInitiated, .utility, .background)
- **Serial vs Concurrent**: Serial queues execute one task at a time, concurrent queues allow parallel execution
- **NSOperationQueue**: Provides dependency management and fine-grained control with queuePriority property

### 3. Task Cancellation and Progress Tracking
- **Cooperative Cancellation**: Tasks can check `Task.isCancelled` and `Task.checkCancellation()` for graceful termination
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Tasks started with `.task()` modifier auto-cancel when views disappear
- **Progress Monitoring**: Operations provide built-in progress tracking capabilities
- **Manual Control**: Tasks can be stored in @State for manual cancellation

### 4. Real-time Mobile App Patterns
- **Task Management**: Swift Tasks provide concurrent execution from non-concurrent contexts
- **Queue-based Execution**: Background queues for work, main queue for UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Structured error handling with try/await and do-catch blocks
- **Thread Safety**: Actors and @MainActor provide thread safety for UI updates

## Command Queue Architecture Design

### Core Components

#### 1. CommandQueue Feature (New TCA Feature)
```swift
@Reducer
struct CommandQueueFeature {
    struct State {
        var queuedCommands: IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand> = []
        var executingCommands: IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand> = []
        var completedCommands: IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand> = []
        var maxConcurrentExecutions: Int = 3
        var isProcessing: Bool = false
    }
    
    enum Action {
        case enqueueCommand(CommandRequest)
        case startExecution
        case commandCompleted(QueuedCommand.ID, CommandResult)
        case cancelCommand(QueuedCommand.ID)
        case cancelAllCommands
        case progressUpdated(QueuedCommand.ID, Double)
    }
}
```

#### 2. QueuedCommand Model
```swift
struct QueuedCommand: Equatable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let request: CommandRequest
    let priority: CommandPriority
    let enqueuedAt: Date
    var status: CommandExecutionStatus
    var progress: Double
    var startedAt: Date?
    var completedAt: Date?
    var result: CommandResult?
    var error: String?
    var task: Task<Void, Never>?
}

enum CommandPriority: Int, CaseIterable {
    case low = 0
    case normal = 1
    case high = 2
    case urgent = 3
}

enum CommandExecutionStatus {
    case queued
    case executing
    case completed
    case failed
    case cancelled
}
```

#### 3. CommandRequest Model
```swift
struct CommandRequest: Equatable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let prompt: String
    let targetSystem: AISystem
    let mode: AIMode
    let enhancementOptions: PromptEnhancementOptions
    let estimatedDuration: TimeInterval?
    let createdAt: Date
}

struct PromptEnhancementOptions: Equatable {
    let includeSystemContext: Bool
    let includeErrorLogs: Bool
    let includeTimestamp: Bool
    let responseFormat: ResponseFormat
}
```

### Queue Management Strategy

#### 1. Priority-Based FIFO Ordering
- **Primary Sort**: Priority level (urgent â†’ high â†’ normal â†’ low)
- **Secondary Sort**: Enqueue timestamp (FIFO within same priority)
- **Dynamic Re-prioritization**: Allow commands to be re-prioritized while queued

#### 2. Concurrent Execution Control
- **Max Concurrent**: Configurable limit (default: 3) for simultaneous command execution
- **System-Based Grouping**: Group commands by target AI system to prevent conflicts
- **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources and adjust concurrency

#### 3. Queue Persistence
- **Local Storage**: Queue state persisted to handle app lifecycle events
- **Recovery**: Restore queue state on app restart, handling interrupted commands
- **History**: Maintain completed command history with configurable retention

## Technical Specifications

### TCA Integration Pattern
```swift
// PromptFeature integration
case .submitPrompt:
    let request = CommandRequest(
        id: UUID(),
        prompt: state.promptPreview,
        targetSystem: state.selectedAISystem,
        mode: state.selectedMode,
        enhancementOptions: PromptEnhancementOptions(
            includeSystemContext: state.includeSystemContext,
            includeErrorLogs: state.includeErrorLogs,
            includeTimestamp: state.includeTimestamp,
            responseFormat: state.responseFormat
        ),
        estimatedDuration: estimateExecutionTime(for: state.selectedAISystem),
        createdAt: Date()
    )
    
    return .send(.delegate(.enqueueCommand(request)))
```

### Async Execution Pattern
```swift
private func executeCommand(_ command: QueuedCommand) async -> CommandResult {
    do {
        // Check cancellation before starting
        try Task.checkCancellation()
        
        // Execute with progress reporting
        let result = try await performAICommand(
            command.request,
            progressCallback: { progress in
                // Send progress updates to store
            }
        )
        
        return .success(result)
    } catch is CancellationError {
        return .cancelled
    } catch {
        return .failure(error)
    }
}
```

### Priority Queue Algorithm
```swift
private func insertWithPriority(_ command: QueuedCommand, into queue: inout IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand>) {
    let insertIndex = queue.firstIndex { existingCommand in
        // Higher priority comes first
        if command.priority.rawValue > existingCommand.priority.rawValue {
            return true
        }
        // Same priority: FIFO order
        if command.priority == existingCommand.priority {
            return command.enqueuedAt < existingCommand.enqueuedAt
        }
        return false
    } ?? queue.endIndex
    
    queue.insert(command, at: insertIndex)
}
```
