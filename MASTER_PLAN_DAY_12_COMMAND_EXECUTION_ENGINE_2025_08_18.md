## Home State Review

### Project Structure

- **Unity Version**: 2021.1.14f1 (.NET Standard 2.0)
- **PowerShell**: 5.1 compatibility maintained
- **Module Architecture**: 12+ modules in Unity-Claude-AutonomousAgent folder

### Current Implementation Status
**COMPLETED**:
- ✅ **Day 8**: Intelligent Prompt Generation Engine (IntelligentPromptEngine.psm1)
- ✅ **Day 9**: Context and Conversation Management (ConversationStateManager.psm1)
- ✅ **Day 10**: Context Optimization (ContextOptimization.psm1)
- ✅ **Day 11**: Error Handling and Retry Logic (ErrorHandling.psm1, FailureMode.psm1)

**CURRENT TARGET - Day 12**: Command Execution Engine Integration

## Implementation Plan - Day 12

### Morning (3 hours): Execution Pipeline
1. **Integrate command execution with response processing pipeline**
   - Connect ResponseParsing.psm1 outputs to execution engine
   - Route commands through safety validation
   - Apply error handling and retry logic

2. **Create execution queue management and prioritization**
   - Implement priority queue for command ordering
   - Support command dependencies and sequencing
   - Handle queue overflow and throttling

3. **Implement parallel execution for independent commands**
   - Use ThreadJob module for PS5.1 compatibility
   - Detect independent vs dependent commands
   - Manage parallel execution limits

4. **Add execution result capture and formatting**
   - Capture stdout, stderr, exit codes
   - Format results for Claude consumption
   - Store results for learning system

### Afternoon (2-3 hours): Safety and Validation Integration
1. **Integrate with existing Unity-Claude-Safety framework**
   - Connect to SafeExecution.psm1 constrained runspace
   - Apply command whitelisting and validation
   - Enforce path boundaries and security restrictions

2. **Add confidence threshold validation for automated execution**
   - Check confidence scores from Classification.psm1
   - Route low-confidence commands to human approval
   - Log confidence decisions for audit trail

3. **Create dry-run capabilities for testing automation**
   - Implement WhatIf pattern for command preview
   - Show what would be executed without running
   - Support simulation mode for testing

4. **Implement human approval workflows for low-confidence operations**
   - Queue low-confidence commands for review
   - Provide context and risk assessment
   - Wait for human approval before execution

## Research Needs

### Research Phase 1 (5 queries)
1. PowerShell execution queue best practices
2. ThreadJob vs BackgroundJob for parallel execution in PS5.1
3. Command dependency detection algorithms
4. Dry-run/WhatIf implementation patterns
5. Priority queue implementations in PowerShell

### Research Phase 2 (5 queries) - After initial implementation
6. Confidence threshold tuning strategies
7. Human-in-the-loop approval workflows
8. Execution result formatting standards
9. Command sequencing and orchestration patterns
10. Safety validation best practices

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### Required Modules
- **SafeExecution.psm1**: Constrained runspace for safe command execution
- **ResponseParsing.psm1**: Parse Claude responses for commands
- **Classification.psm1**: Command confidence scoring
- **ErrorHandling.psm1**: Retry logic and circuit breakers
- **AgentLogging.psm1**: Comprehensive audit trail

### Integration Requirements
- Must maintain PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
- Use ThreadJob for parallel execution (not ForEach-Object -Parallel)
- ASCII-only characters throughout
- No backtick characters
- Proper variable delimiting

## Success Criteria
- Execution pipeline successfully routes commands through safety validation
- Queue management handles prioritization and dependencies
- Parallel execution works for independent commands
- Confidence thresholds properly gate automated execution
- Dry-run mode provides accurate command preview
- Human approval workflow functions for low-confidence operations
- All tests pass with >90% success rate

## Risk Assessment
- **Queue overflow**: Implement throttling and backpressure
- **Parallel execution conflicts**: Use proper synchronization
- **Safety bypass**: Multiple validation layers required
- **Performance impact**: Monitor execution overhead
- **Human approval delays**: Implement timeout and escalation
