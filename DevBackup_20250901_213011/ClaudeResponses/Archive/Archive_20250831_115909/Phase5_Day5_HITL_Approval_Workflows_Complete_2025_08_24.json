Test covers module import, database initialization, token security, approval request creation, notification system, configuration management, LangGraph bridge integration, end-to-end workflow, performance testing, and error handling. Use parameters: -SaveResults to save test results, -Verbose for detailed logging, -SkipLangGraphTests if LangGraph server not available, -QuickTest for faster execution. Expected: 80%+ pass rate indicating production readiness of Human-in-the-Loop approval system."
