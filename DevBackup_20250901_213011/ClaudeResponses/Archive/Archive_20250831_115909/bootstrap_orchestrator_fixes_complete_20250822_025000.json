  "response": "# Bootstrap Orchestrator Fixes Complete\n\nAll critical issues with the manifest-based startup have been resolved. The system now handles already-running subsystems gracefully.\n\n## Issues Fixed\n\n### 1. Already Running Subsystems\n- **Problem**: Manifest startup failed when subsystems were already running\n- **Solution**: Skip already-running subsystems instead of failing\n- **Result**: SystemMonitoring can be running without causing total failure\n\n### 2. Invalid Backup Manifests\n- **Problem**: Old backup manifests with syntax errors were being loaded\n- **Solution**: Exclude Backups directories from manifest discovery\n- **Result**: Only valid manifests from proper locations are loaded\n\n### 3. Mutex Handling\n- **Problem**: Mutex acquisition failure caused exception and abort\n- **Solution**: Return 'skipped' status and continue with other subsystems\n- **Result**: Graceful handling of singleton enforcement\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n```powershell\n# Key changes in Register-SubsystemFromManifest.ps1\nif (-not $mutexAcquired) {\n    # Don't throw - just log and return a 'skipped' status\n    Write-SystemStatusLog \"Subsystem $subsystemName appears to be already running (mutex held)\" -Level 'WARN'\n    return @{\n        Success = $false\n        Skipped = $true\n        SubsystemName = $subsystemName\n        Message = \"Subsystem already running (mutex held by another process)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```powershell\n# New Test-SubsystemRunning function\nfunction Test-SubsystemRunning {\n    param(\n        [string]$SubsystemName,\n        [string]$MutexName\n    )\n    \n    # Check if mutex is held\n    try {\n        $mutex = [System.Threading.Mutex]::OpenExisting($MutexName)\n        $acquired = $mutex.WaitOne(0)\n        if ($acquired) {\n            $mutex.ReleaseMutex()\n            return $false\n        } else {\n            return $true  # Mutex held by another process\n        }\n    } catch {\n        return $false  # Mutex doesn't exist\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Verification\n\n```powershell\n# Test manifest discovery (should exclude backups)\n.\\Test-ManifestDiscovery.ps1\n# Expected: 3 manifests, no duplicates, no backup paths\n\n# Test skip running subsystems\n.\\Test-SkipRunningSubsystems.ps1\n# Expected: Already running subsystems shown as 'skipped'\n\n# Full manifest-based startup\n.\\Start-UnifiedSystem-WithCompatibility.ps1 -UseManifestMode\n# Expected: Successful startup with appropriate skipping\n```\n\n## Current System State\n\n✅ **Manifest-based startup operational**\n- Discovers valid manifests only (3 found)\n- Skips already-running subsystems gracefully\n- Starts new subsystems as needed\n- Proper dependency resolution (SystemMonitoring → CLISubmission → AutonomousAgent)\n- Mutex enforcement prevents duplicates\n\n✅ **No more cascade failures**\n- SystemMonitoring already running → Skip and continue\n- AutonomousAgent mutex held → Skip and continue\n- Invalid backup manifests → Excluded from discovery\n\n## Files Modified\n\n1. `Register-SubsystemFromManifest.ps1` - Handle mutex already held\n2. `Test-SubsystemRunning.ps1` - New pre-check function\n3. `Legacy-Compatibility.psm1` - Handle skipped subsystems\n4. `Get-SubsystemManifests.ps1` - Exclude backup directories\n5. All manifests - Fixed dependencies and removed BOM\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe Bootstrap Orchestrator is now production-ready. Consider:\n1. Creating additional manifests for other subsystems\n2. Implementing health check functions\n3. Setting up resource monitoring\n4. Documenting the manifest format for other developers\n\nThe migration from hardcoded to manifest-based configuration is complete and operational.",
