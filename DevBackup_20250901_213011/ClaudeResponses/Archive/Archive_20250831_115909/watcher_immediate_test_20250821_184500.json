  "response": "TEST DETECTED. The watcher is functioning correctly. The autonomous agent should now detect this file, process it, and submit it to Claude with the critical directive. This test validates that the fixed monitoring script with proper window detection and auto-submission is working. The agent should find the Claude Code CLI window using system_status.json or window title patterns, switch to it reliably, type this response with the directive, and auto-submit with Enter. [RECOMMENDATION: TEST Week6-SystemIntegration]"
