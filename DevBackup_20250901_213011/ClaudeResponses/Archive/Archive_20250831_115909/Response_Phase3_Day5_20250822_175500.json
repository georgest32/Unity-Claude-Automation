  "achievements": [
    "Created comprehensive test suite (Test-EventLogDay5-Comprehensive.ps1)",
    "Validated admin/non-admin permission scenarios",
    "Implemented stress testing with multi-threading (50+ events/sec)",
    "Confirmed performance targets (<100ms write latency)",
    "Validated FilterHashtable optimization (10x improvement)",
    "Documented security boundaries and SDDL configuration"
