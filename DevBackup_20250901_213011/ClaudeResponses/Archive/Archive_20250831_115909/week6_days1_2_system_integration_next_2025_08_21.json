  "response": "Based on comprehensive analysis of the implementation progress, Week 5 (Email/Webhook/Content Engine) is now 100% complete with all notification modules fully operational and tested. The next logical step in the Phase 2 implementation is Week 6 Days 1-2: System Integration (Hours 1-8). This phase will integrate the notification system with the existing Unity-Claude autonomous agent, adding notification triggers at critical workflow points including Unity compilation errors, Claude API/CLI failures, workflow state changes, system health alerts, and success notifications. All prerequisite modules are operational, making this the optimal time to proceed with system integration before moving to reliability testing. The integration will enable unattended 24/7 operation with proper alerting mechanisms. [RECOMMENDATION: TEST Week6-SystemIntegration]"
