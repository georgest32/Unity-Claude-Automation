    "response": "RECOMMENDATION: TEST - Test-Week6Days3-4-TestingReliability.ps1: Execute comprehensive testing and reliability validation suite to verify Week 6 Days 3-4 implementation. Tests circuit breaker patterns, dead letter queue management, multi-channel fallback delivery, performance monitoring, and end-to-end reliability. Also run Test-NotificationReliabilityFramework.ps1 for detailed email/webhook delivery testing. Expected 80%+ success rate indicating production-ready notification reliability infrastructure.",
