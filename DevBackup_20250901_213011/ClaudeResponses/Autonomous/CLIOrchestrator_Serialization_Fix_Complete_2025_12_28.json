  "RESPONSE": "DEBUGGING - CLIOrchestrator path corruption issue has been fixed. The problem was PowerShell's default ToString() method on hashtables returning type information instead of content. Implemented Convert-ToSerializedString helper function to properly extract file paths and serialize complex objects before string interpolation. Test script created at Test-CLIOrchestrator-Serialization.ps1 to validate the fix works correctly with various object types."
