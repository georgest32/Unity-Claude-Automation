    "RESPONSE": "RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE: Begin Week 1 Day 1 of the Enhanced Documentation Second Pass Implementation Plan. Start by implementing thread-safe CPG operations in Modules/Unity-Claude-CPG/Core/CPG-ThreadSafeOperations.psm1. The gap analysis shows 35% completion with critical missing components including thread safety, call graphs, Tree-sitter integration, and D3.js visualization. Follow the detailed 4-week sprint plan created in Enhanced_Documentation_Second_Pass_Implementation_2025_08_28.md, which provides day-by-day tasks with specific file paths and implementation details."
