    "RESPONSE": "RECOMMENDATION: TEST - ./Test-BoilerplateSubmission-Fixed.ps1: Run the fixed boilerplate submission test to verify the enhanced workflow loads correctly and uses proper format. Then test the actual orchestrator with a real signal file to confirm the line-by-line submission issue is resolved and proper boilerplate format is used. The fixes address the root causes: updated Submit-TestResultsToClaude to use New-BoilerplatePrompt function, enhanced WindowManager Submit-ToClaudeWindow to use clipboard paste instead of character-by-character typing, and integrated all enhanced functions into the main orchestrator workflow."
