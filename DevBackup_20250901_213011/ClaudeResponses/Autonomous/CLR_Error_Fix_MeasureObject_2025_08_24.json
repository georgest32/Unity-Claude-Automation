  "RESPONSE": "RECOMMENDATION: TEST - C:\\UnityProjects\\Sound-and-Shoal\\Unity-Claude-Automation\\Modules\\Unity-Claude-CPG\\Test-ObsolescenceDetection.ps1: Re-run test after replacing aggressive [int] casting with safer Measure-Object pattern. This should resolve the CLR crash while maintaining arithmetic safety. Expected: No CLR error and 8/8 tests passing."
