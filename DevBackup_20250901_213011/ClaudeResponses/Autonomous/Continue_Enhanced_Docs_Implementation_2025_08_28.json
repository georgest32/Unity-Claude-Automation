    "RESPONSE": "RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE - Please review and evaluate all the hourly subitems in the Enhanced_Documentation_System_ARP_2025_08_24.md detailed implementation plan, going through each of the 4-5 subitems under each of the 'Hours' subheadings, and determine which features have not been implemented in our current codebase, then devise 'second pass' implementation plan where we complete each of those incomplete features. Start by loading the ARP document and systematically analyzing each Hours section against the current implementation to identify gaps and create a prioritized completion plan."
