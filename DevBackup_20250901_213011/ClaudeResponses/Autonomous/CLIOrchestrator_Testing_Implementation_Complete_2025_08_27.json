  "RESPONSE": "RECOMMENDATION: TEST - C:\\UnityProjects\\Sound-and-Shoal\\Unity-Claude-Automation\\Test-CLIOrchestrator-Enhanced.ps1: Create and run a test script to validate the enhanced CLIOrchestrator Testing prompt-type handling. The test should: 1) Create a Testing prompt-type JSON file, 2) Verify the orchestrator detects and processes it, 3) Check that a test gets executed, 4) Confirm results are saved to a file, 5) Validate Claude submission attempt. Monitor the debug output to ensure all steps complete successfully."
