  "RESPONSE": "RECOMMENDATION: TEST - C:\\UnityProjects\\Sound-and-Shoal\\Unity-Claude-Automation\\Test-Day2-CallGraphDataFlow.ps1: Execute the comprehensive test suite to validate Call Graph Builder and Data Flow Tracker implementations. The test will analyze a sample script, build call graphs and data flow, detect recursive calls and taint issues, and generate detailed metrics. Expected: 25 test cases covering both modules and integration scenarios."
