Detailed results saved to: Week2Day3-SemanticAnalysis-TestResults-20250828-142807.json

=== IMPLEMENTATION ACHIEVEMENTS ===
1. AST-based pattern detection with confidence scoring
2. Custom CHM/CHD cohesion metrics implementation
3. Enhanced maintainability index with cohesion/coupling integration
4. Comprehensive quality analysis framework
5. Integration with existing CPG infrastructure

[GOOD] Achieved 80%+ pass rate - Minor issues may need attention

Week 2 Day 3 Semantic Analysis implementation complete.
Ready to proceed with Week 2 Day 4-5: D3.js Visualization Foundation
