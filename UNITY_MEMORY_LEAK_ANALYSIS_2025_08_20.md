# Unity Memory Leak Analysis and Cleanup Implementation
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Time**: 12:20 PM  
**Context**: Autonomous agent recommendation to analyze Unity Editor logs for memory leak patterns
**Previous Context**: Autonomous agent debugging session completed, window detection fixed

## Problem Summary

Autonomous agent has identified a need to analyze Unity Editor logs for memory leak patterns and implement automatic cleanup routines. This is part of Phase 4 Advanced Features optimization.

## Current System State

### Project Context
- **Current Focus**: Phase 4 Advanced Features - Memory Optimization
- **Environment**: Unity 2021.1.14f1, PowerShell 5.1, autonomous agent operational
- **Log Source**: C:\Users\georg\AppData\Local\Unity\Editor\Editor.log
- **Status**: Autonomous agent successfully submitting recommendations

### Unity Editor Log Analysis (Recent Memory Activity)

#### Memory Usage Patterns Observed:
```
System memory in use before: 415.5 MB.
System memory in use after: 409.3 MB.

Unloading 795 unused Assets to reduce memory usage. Loaded Objects now: 8677.
Total: 10.613200 ms (FindLiveObjects: 0.411300 ms CreateObjectMapping: 0.192700 ms MarkObjects: 8.896700 ms DeleteObjects: 1.111500 ms)

Unloading 794 Unused Serialized files (Serialized files now loaded: 0)
```

#### Asset Processing Memory Impact:
```
ImportAndPostprocessOutOfDateAssets: 531.008ms
PostProcessAllAssets: 473.174ms  
RefreshProfiler: Total: 729.534ms
```

#### Shader Compilation Issues:
```
Shader 'NatureManufacture/Particles/Fire Unlit': fallback shader 'Hidden/Shader Graph/FallbackError' not found
Shader 'NatureManufacture/Particles/Smoke Normalmap Lit': fallback shader 'Hidden/Shader Graph/FallbackError' not found
(Multiple shader fallback errors)
```

## Initial Memory Pattern Observations

### Positive Memory Management:
- Unity automatically unloading 795 unused assets (6.2 MB memory reduction)
- Efficient garbage collection timing (10.6ms total)
- Good memory cleanup ratios (415.5 MB → 409.3 MB)

### Potential Memory Leak Indicators:
- High asset processing times (531ms for imports)
- Shader fallback errors suggesting missing shaders
- 8677 loaded objects after cleanup (potentially high)
- PostProcessAllAssets taking 473ms (65% of total import time)

### SymbolicMemory System Activity:
- Roslyn AST Parser with 45 valid references
- EnhancedAssetPostprocessor processing imports
- Active symbolic memory system during asset operations

## Current Implementation Plan Status

From IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:
- **Phase 4**: Advanced Features (90% complete)
- **Target**: Parallel processing, Event Log integration, Dashboard
- **Success Criteria**: 85% automated fix rate, <30s resolution time
- **Current**: Memory optimization not explicitly planned

## Next Research Topics Identified

1. **Unity Memory Profiling APIs** - Built-in memory analysis tools
2. **Asset Memory Management** - Proper asset lifecycle management
3. **Shader Memory Leaks** - Missing fallback shader impact
4. **Roslyn AST Memory Usage** - Memory patterns in symbolic memory system
5. **Asset Postprocessor Optimization** - Reducing processing time/memory

## Files and Systems Involved

### Unity Log Sources:
- Editor.log: C:\Users\georg\AppData\Local\Unity\Editor\Editor.log
- Console logs: Current_errors.json system

### Automation Systems:
- SymbolicMemory system (Roslyn AST parsing)
- EnhancedAssetPostprocessor (asset processing)
- Unity-Claude-Automation (monitoring and analysis)

### Memory Analysis Tools to Research:
- Unity Profiler API
- EditorUtility.UnloadUnusedAssetsImmediate()
- Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()
- Garbage collection patterns

## Preliminary Solution Framework

### Immediate Analysis Needs:
1. **Pattern Detection** - Identify memory growth patterns in logs
2. **Threshold Analysis** - Determine when cleanup is needed
3. **Asset Tracking** - Monitor loaded object counts over time
4. **Shader Issue Resolution** - Fix missing fallback shaders

### Automation Integration:
1. **Log Monitoring** - FileSystemWatcher for Editor.log changes
2. **Memory Metrics Extraction** - Parse memory usage from logs
3. **Cleanup Triggers** - Automatic cleanup based on thresholds
4. **Performance Impact Assessment** - Measure cleanup effectiveness

## Research Findings (4 Web Queries)

### Query 1: Unity Memory Profiler and Leak Detection
**Key Findings**:
- Memory Profiler package provides snapshot comparison for leak detection
- EditorUtility.UnloadUnusedAssetsImmediate() waits for completion (vs async Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets)
- Workflow: Take snapshot → Monitor growth → Unload scene → Compare snapshots
- Memory profiling overhead can cause temporary freezes and memory allocation

### Query 2: Application.logMessageReceived Performance Impact
**Key Findings**:
- logMessageReceived fires on main thread, logMessageReceivedThreaded for any thread
- All logs affect performance even in release builds - "terrible framerate" resolved by removing logs
- Handler code must be thread-safe for logMessageReceivedThreaded
- Use UNITY_EDITOR compiler directive to reduce build impact

### Query 3: Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets Automation
**Key Findings**:
- Unloads assets not reached by walking object hierarchy + script components
- Operation is slow and blocks main thread - users notice hitches
- Automatically called during non-additive scene loads and OS memory warnings
- Combine with System.GC.Collect() but they handle different memory types (native vs managed)

### Query 4: Memory Pattern Parsing and Threshold Detection
**Key Findings**:
- Pattern: `@"System memory in use[:\s]+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(MB|GB|KB)"` for parsing
- Unity 2021.1 enhanced memory profiling with APIs for real-time monitoring
- Common approach: Regex parsing + threshold comparison + automated alerts
- Memory Profiler package APIs for integration with custom monitoring

## Memory Leak Patterns Identified from Editor.log

### Asset Processing Memory Growth:
- ImportAndPostprocessOutOfDateAssets: 531ms (heavy processing)
- PostProcessAllAssets: 473ms (65% of import time)
- RefreshProfiler: 729ms total processing time

### Memory Management Positive Indicators:
- Automatic unloading: "Unloading 795 unused Assets" (6.2MB reduction)
- Efficient GC: 10.6ms total (FindLiveObjects: 0.4ms, DeleteObjects: 1.1ms)
- Good cleanup ratio: 415.5 MB → 409.3 MB

### Potential Memory Issues:
- 8677 loaded objects after cleanup (potentially high)
- Shader fallback errors indicating missing shaders
- SymbolicMemory system with 45 Roslyn references (high memory potential)

## Implementation Architecture

### Unity C# Components:
```csharp
// MemoryMonitor.cs - Automated memory tracking
public class MemoryMonitor : EditorWindow
{
    private static float memoryThresholdMB = 500f;
    private static List<MemoryReading> readings = new List<MemoryReading>();
    
    [InitializeOnLoadMethod]
    static void Initialize()
    {
        Application.logMessageReceived += OnLogMessage;
        EditorApplication.update += CheckMemoryThresholds;
    }
}
```

### PowerShell Module Integration:
```powershell
# Unity-Claude-MemoryAnalysis.psm1
function Start-UnityMemoryMonitoring {
    # FileSystemWatcher for Editor.log changes
    # Parse memory usage patterns
    # Trigger cleanup when thresholds exceeded
}
```

### Cleanup Automation:
- Threshold-based: >500MB warning, >1GB cleanup
- Time-based: Every 30 minutes during idle
- Asset-based: >10000 loaded objects trigger
- Integration with autonomous agent recommendation system

## Risk Assessment

### Performance Risks:
- Memory monitoring overhead (handled with efficient parsing)
- Cleanup hitches during UnloadUnusedAssets (scheduled during natural pauses)
- Log parsing performance impact (mitigated with optimized regex)

- Interrupting critical Unity operations during cleanup
- Integration conflicts with SymbolicMemory system
