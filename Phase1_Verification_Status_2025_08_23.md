## Summary

### Completed Tasks (7/8)
- ✅ WSL2 2.5.10.0 (exceeds minimum requirement of 2.1.5)
- ✅ Python 3.12.3 in WSL2 (exceeds minimum requirement of 3.10+)
- ✅ PowerShell 7.5.2 configured
- ✅ ripgrep 14.1.0 with PCRE2 support
- ✅ Universal Ctags 5.9.0
- ✅ Git 2.49.0.windows.1
- ✅ MCP directory structure created

### Missing Components (1/8)
- ❌ **Docker Desktop**: Not installed - required for containerization in later phases

### Recommendations
1. **Docker Desktop Installation**: Not critical for Phase 4 (Multi-Agent Orchestration) but will be needed for Phase 6 (Production Deployment)
2. **MCP Server Configuration**: Directory structure exists but actual server configuration may need completion
3. **Ready to Proceed**: Environment is sufficiently prepared for Phase 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Next Steps
With 87.5% of Phase 1 complete and all critical components for Phase 4 installed, we can proceed with:
- Phase 4, Day 1-2: LangGraph Integration
- Hours 1-4: Python Environment Setup (using existing Python 3.12.3 in WSL2)
