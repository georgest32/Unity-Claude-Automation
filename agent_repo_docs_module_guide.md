# Autonomous Repo Analyst & Docs Module — Architecture, Orchestration Choice, and MCP Usage

**Audience:** Engineering leads and infra/tooling engineers building a multi‑agent system where one module analyzes a repo (its own codebase) and continuously creates/updates documentation.  
**Scope:** Architecture, concrete repo layout, analysis & docs pipelines, orchestration choice (LangGraph vs AutoGen), and how MCP ties tools safely to Claude Code CLI / Cursor.

---

## Executive summary

- Build the **Repo Analyst + Docs** module around deterministic local indexes (ripgrep, ctags, LSP/Tree‑sitter) and let the agent reason on top. This keeps results fast, diff‑aware, and precise. citeturn2search0turn2search1turn2search2turn2search3  
- Treat docs as code: generate API references (DocFX/TypeDoc/Sphinx/Doxygen), lint prose (Vale) and Markdown (markdownlint), and publish with MkDocs Material or Docusaurus. citeturn3search1turn3search2turn3search3turn3search4turn3search5turn3search7turn3search8  
- Use **LangGraph** as the **orchestration backbone** for durable, human‑in‑the‑loop, multi‑agent workflows; embed **AutoGen GroupChat** inside nodes for collaborative ideation/drafting. citeturn0search6turn0search13turn0search1turn0search2turn0search5  
- Standardize tool access with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** so **Claude Code** and **Cursor** can call the same local/remote tools safely (grep, ctags, lint, build, test, docgen). citeturn1search0turn1search5turn1search2  
- Keep humans in control with **GitHub protected branches** and **CODEOWNERS**. Agents only open PRs with artifacts and previews. citeturn4search0turn4search1

## 1) System architecture (multi‑agent)

**Teams (agents):**
- **Repo Analyst + Docs (this module):** code graph & static checks; maps diffs to docs; generates/updates API & guides; opens PRs.
- **Research Lab:** evaluates alternatives via experiments/design memos; hands decisions to Analyst for integration plans. (Use AutoGen GroupChat for collaborative rounds.) citeturn0search2turn0search5
- **Implementers:** apply accepted changes, migrations, and optimizations; their PRs also pass docs & quality gates.

**Backbone orchestration:** a **LangGraph** app with persistent state, HITL checkpoints, and multi‑agent routing (supervisor/swarm topologies). citeturn0search6turn0search18

**Tool plane:** an **MCP** server (or several) exposing approved capabilities to both front‑ends (Claude Code CLI, Cursor) and to the orchestrator. citeturn1search0

**Governance:** protected branches + required reviews and **CODEOWNERS** enforced in CI. citeturn4search0turn4search2turn4search1

## 3) Analysis pipeline (deterministic first, LLM on top)

**A. Build a navigable “code graph”**
- **ripgrep** for fast, .gitignore‑aware scanning and delta detection. citeturn2search0turn2search8
- **universal‑ctags** to index symbols & definitions across languages. citeturn2search1
- **LSP &/or Tree‑sitter** to enrich definitions/refs/diagnostics programmatically. citeturn2search2turn2search6turn2search7

Artifacts saved in `.ai/cache`: `defs.json`, `refs.json`, `codegraph.tags`, `deltas.json`, `lint.json`.

**B. Static checks (language‑specific)**
- JS/TS: ESLint; Python: Pylint/Mypy; C#: Roslyn analyzers; etc. (Use language‑native linters and/or Sonar as umbrella if desired.)

**C. LLM reasoning tasks**
- “Map the repo” (subsystems, entry points, hotspots).
- “Explain this diff” (summarize risk & create review checklist).
- “Pinpoint doc gaps” (symbols without API docs; changed code touching outdated guides).

> These primitives are fast and deterministic; the LLM reasons over the indexes rather than “searching” blindly.

---

## 4) Documentation pipeline (Docs‑as‑Code)

**API references (by language):**
- **C#/.NET (Unity‑friendly):** **DocFX** converts XML code comments and Markdown into HTML or JSON. citeturn3search1
- **TypeScript/JS:** **TypeDoc** generates HTML or JSON from TS comments. citeturn3search2turn3search10
- **Python:** **Sphinx `autodoc`** imports modules and extracts docstrings. citeturn3search3
- **C/C++ (and others):** **Doxygen** with classic tag‑style comments. citeturn3search4

**Guides site (curated content):**
- **MkDocs + Material** for simple, Markdown‑first docs. citeturn3search5turn3search20
- **Docusaurus** (React/MDX) when you need versioned docs and custom UI. citeturn3search0turn3search15

**Prose/format gates:**
- **Vale** for style/terminology rules. citeturn3search7
- **markdownlint** / **markdownlint‑cli2** for consistent Markdown. citeturn3search8turn3search17

**Docs CI (example):** on PR, build API docs → run Vale + markdownlint → publish a preview (Pages/Netlify); on `main`, deploy.

---

## 5) Orchestration choice: LangGraph vs AutoGen

**Recommendation:** make **LangGraph the spine** (durable state, HITL, retries, conditional routing) and embed **AutoGen GroupChat** **inside** LangGraph nodes for collaborative brainstorming/drafting where it helps.  
- LangGraph: stateful orchestration, checkpointers (SQLite/Postgres), and **human‑in‑the‑loop** via `interrupt()` for approvals. citeturn0search8turn0search6turn0search13
- AutoGen: high‑level **GroupChat** collaboration patterns (many agents share a topic; human can participate) and extensions, including MCP adapters. citeturn0search2turn0search5turn0search12turn0search3

**When to flip the choice:** If your centerpiece is open‑ended collaborative conversation with minimal process control, an end‑to‑end AutoGen implementation is viable; otherwise LangGraph’s durability and HITL controls fit repo/PR workflows better. citeturn0search14

---

## 6) MCP: what it is and how you use it here

**What:** **Model Context Protocol** standardizes how LLM apps connect to tools/data (think “USB‑C for AI”), with servers exposing tools/resources and clients (agents, IDEs, CLIs) consuming them. citeturn1search0

**Why:** give agents explicit, typed capabilities (no arbitrary shell), make calls auditable, and reuse the same toolbelt from different front‑ends.

**Tooling support today:**  
- **Claude Code**: CLI + desktop wire to MCP; official docs show how to connect tools. citeturn1search1turn1search5turn1search8  
- **Cursor**: supports MCP servers (notably Tools; other features evolving). citeturn1search2turn1search6turn1search12  
- **AutoGen**: adapters for MCP over HTTP/SSE; “McpWorkbench” extension. citeturn0search3turn0search12

**Your MCP “toolbelt” (examples):**
- `rg_search` (ripgrep), `ctags_lookup` (symbols), `git_diff`, `run_lint`, `build_docs`, `run_tests`, `vale_lint`, `markdownlint`.
- Optional: `lsp_query` (definitions/refs/diagnostics), `typedoc`, `docfx`, `sphinx`, `doxygen`.

**Sample MCP server config (sketch):**
```json
{
  "name": "local-tools",
  "command": "bash",
  "args": ["-lc", "exec mcp-local"], 
  "tools": [
    {"name":"rg_search","description":"ripgrep search","schema":{"pattern":"string","path":"string"}},
    {"name":"ctags_lookup","description":"Find symbol","schema":{"symbol":"string"}},
    {"name":"git_diff","description":"Diff range","schema":{"base":"string","head":"string"}},
    {"name":"build_docs","description":"Run doc generators","schema":{"scope":"string"}},
    {"name":"run_lint","description":"Run language linters","schema":{"target":"string"}},
    {"name":"vale_lint","description":"Prose check","schema":{"path":"string"}},
    {"name":"markdownlint","description":"Markdown check","schema":{"globs":"string"}}
  ]
}
```

> Because both **Claude Code** and **Cursor** speak MCP, the same toolbelt works across both. citeturn1search5turn1search2

---

## 7) CLI integration (Claude Code & Cursor)

- **Claude Code** can edit files, run commands, create commits; pair it with the MCP toolbelt for safe access to your repo, CI, and docs systems. citeturn1search8  
- **Cursor** can install and call MCP servers, letting the Composer/CLI reuse the same toolbelt. citeturn1search6

House rules to keep in `.ai/rules/`:
- Prefer MCP tools over raw shell.
- Never push to `main`; always open PR with artifacts and previews.
- Link to code‑graph hits and linter outputs in PR description.

---

## 8) Governance, safety, and change control

- **Protected branches** with required reviews & required status checks. citeturn4search0turn4search2  
- **CODEOWNERS** to auto‑request domain reviewers (docs owners for `*.md`, language owners for `*.cs`, `*.ts`, etc.). citeturn4search1

**Example `CODEOWNERS`:**
```text
docs/**          @docs-team
*.md             @docs-team
**/*.cs          @engine-csharp
**/*.{ts,tsx}    @engine-web
```

---

## 9) Rollout plan (phased)

**Phase 1 (days):** Wire MCP toolbelt (rg/ctags/docs/lint) → agents can answer “where is X?” and “what changed?” and open docs‑only PRs. citeturn2search0turn2search1  
**Phase 2:** Add LSP & richer static analyzers; turn on protected branches + CODEOWNERS. citeturn2search2turn4search0  
**Phase 3:** Full docs pipeline with previews and prose gating. citeturn3search5turn3search7  
**Phase 4:** Research Lab via AutoGen GroupChat; connect artifacts back into LangGraph workflow. citeturn0search2turn0search6

##Original ChatGPT conversation (please read for information on planning and building multi-agent system)

****START OF CONVO****

"what is the best way to structure a module for autonomous agents (running claude code cli or cursor CLI) to analyze the code in the same project the module belongs to, and also create and update documentation? This module should be built inside a system that includes other teams of autonomous agents with different goals (EG another team could be involved in researching and proposing alternative approaches and solutions that would be better than current implementations, and another team could be responsible for implementing updates and rebuilding/optimizing/improving modules). please perform extensive research so we have the best approach and architectural strategy moving forward
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 3m 8s

awesome question — here’s a battle-tested way to structure an autonomous “Repo Analyst + Docs” module that can (a) analyze the same codebase it lives in, (b) propose fixes, and (c) keep documentation first-class — while playing nicely inside a larger multi-agent program with other “research” and “implementation” teams.

I’ll give you: (1) the high-level architecture, (2) the concrete project layout, (3) the analysis pipeline (code graph + static checks + LSP), (4) the docs pipeline (autogen + style/lint + site), (5) orchestration notes for Claude Code CLI and Cursor CLI, (6) governance & safety (PR gating, CODEOWNERS), and (7) a phased rollout. I’ve verified key moving parts and cited the load-bearing bits.

1) High-level architecture (inside a multi-agent system)

Teams (agents):

Repo Analyst + Docs (this module): builds a code graph, summarizes deltas, suggests/refactors, updates API/How-To docs, opens PRs.

Research Lab: prototypes alternatives (algorithms, libraries, designs), writes design memos and ADRs; hands findings to Analyst for integration planning.

Implementers: execute accepted proposals, performance passes, migrations; also open PRs.

Shared substrate:

Orchestrator (LangGraph, AutoGen, or your own): manages roles, routes tasks, caps tool permissions. LangGraph is popular for stateful multi-agent workflows; AutoGen is a strong alternative with AgentChat and MCP support. 
GitHub
+1

Tool plane via MCP: expose local tools (grep, git, build, test, docgen) to both Claude Code and Cursor through Model Context Protocol servers; both tools support MCP integrations. 
Anthropic
Cursor

Governance: protected branches + required reviews + CODEOWNERS; the agents only push PRs. 
GitHub Docs
+1

2) Concrete repo layout (minimal, language-agnostic)
repo/
  .ai/
    mcp/                 # MCP server configs for tools (rg, ctags, build, test, docgen)
    cache/               # code graphs, embeddings, summaries (no secrets)
    rules/               # “house rules” for Cursor/Claude Code
  agents/
    analyst_docs/        # this module (planner, tools, prompts, run scripts)
    research_lab/        # research team agents (design memos, ADRs)
    implementers/        # refactorers, migration bots
  docs/
    api/                 # generated API docs (DocFX/TypeDoc/Sphinx/etc.)
    guides/              # curated hand-written docs
    index.md
  scripts/
    codegraph/           # tree-sitter/ctags/rg/LSP helpers
    docs/                # doc generation wrappers
  .github/workflows/
    docs.yml             # build API docs, run Vale/markdownlint, publish site
    analysis.yml         # nightly code graph rebuild, trend report, open issues/PRs
  CODEOWNERS
  mkdocs.yml or docusaurus.config.js

3) Analysis pipeline (fast, deterministic, local-first)

A. Build a navigable “code graph” each run

ripgrep for ultra-fast, .gitignore-aware scanning & change detection. 
GitHub
Debian Manpages

universal-ctags to index symbols (functions/classes) across languages. 
docs.ctags.io

Tree-sitter or LSP (when available) to enrich jumps/refs and diagnostics:

LSP is the vendor-neutral way IDEs get “go-to-def”, diagnostics, hover, etc. You can spin language servers locally and query via JSON-RPC. 
Microsoft GitHub

Output artifacts saved to .ai/cache:

codegraph.tags (ctags index), defs.json (symbols), refs.json (refs), deltas.json (since last run), lint.json (static checks).

B. Static checks (language-specific)

JS/TS: ESLint. Python: Pylint/Mypy. C#: Roslyn analyzers. SonarQube as optional umbrella. (Authoritative docs for each: ESLint, Pylint, Roslyn, SonarQube.) 
Unity Discussions
Conventional Commits
typedoc.org
GitHub

C. Summarization tasks for the agent

“Map the repo”: subsystem list, entry points, hot spots (files with high churn / warnings).

“Explain this diff”: convert git diff into a human-readable change summary + review checklist.

“Pinpoint doc gaps”: match public symbols without API docs; match changed code to stale guides.

Why these primitives? They are predictable, fast, and don’t require calling a model just to locate things. The LLM does the reasoning on top of these deterministic indexes.

4) Documentation pipeline (Docs-as-Code)

A. Generate API docs automatically (language aware)

C# (Unity): DocFX (reads XML doc comments; integrates nicely in CI). 
GitHub

TypeScript/JS: TypeDoc. 
LangChain

Python: Sphinx with autodoc. 
CrewAI

C/C++ (and others): Doxygen. 
Microsoft GitHub

B. Curated guides site (hand-written content)

Choose MkDocs + Material (simple, Markdown-first) or Docusaurus (React/MDX, versioned docs).

MkDocs/MkDocs-Material basics. 
mkdocs.org
squidfunk.github.io

Docusaurus docs plugin and structure/versioning. 
docusaurus.io
+1

C. Prose quality gates

Vale for prose style (brand terms, clarity) + markdownlint for Markdown rules; both run locally and in CI. 
vale.sh
GitHub

D. Docs CI (example flow)

On PR / nightly: build API docs → run Vale + markdownlint → publish preview.

On main: build & deploy site (GitHub Pages/Netlify).
(MkDocs/Docusaurus have official guides for content routing and deploys.) 
docusaurus.io

5) Orchestrating with Claude Code CLI & Cursor CLI (together)

Unify both CLIs behind the same MCP toolbelt

Use MCP to expose your local tools (grep, ctags, LSP, build, test, docgen) to either agent. Both Claude Code and Cursor support MCP, so the same tools are reusable. 
Anthropic
Cursor

Claude Code (CLI & Rules)

Ship a rules.claude.md in .ai/rules/ for safe ops (no destructive commands, prefer PRs, cite indexes).

Wire MCP servers in ~/.config/claude/mcp/*.json. Anthropic’s docs cover connecting tools via MCP. 
Anthropic
+1

Cursor (CLI & Rules)

Cursor CLI supports “rules”, non-interactive runs and JSON output; keep a parallel rules file and invoke with MCP attached. 
Cursor

Why MCP first? It gives you a standard, least-privilege way to attach tools and data to agents (and swap front-ends later). That’s the direction the ecosystem has been moving. 
Model Context Protocol
+1

Optional orchestrator
Wrap both CLIs under an orchestrator (LangGraph or AutoGen) to assign tasks to teams, fan-out/fan-in, and retain per-team memory/state. AutoGen’s AgentChat shows multi-agent and MCP integration; LangGraph is widely used for graph-shaped agent workflows. 
GitHub
+1

6) Governance, safety, and change control

Hard rails

Protected branches: main is protected; merges require passing status checks and approvals. 
GitHub Docs

CODEOWNERS: auto-request human reviews for touched areas (docs owners, language owners). 
GitHub Docs

Agents never push to main; they open PRs with:

a structured change summary,

before/after code snippets,

links to code graph hits, lint results, and doc previews.

Docs PRs

Require Vale + markdownlint passing; require docs owners’ review.

Security note for MCP

Only connect to trusted MCP servers; MCP tools can have file/system access. (AutoGen warns similarly when launching MCP tools.) 
GitHub

7) The “Analyst + Docs” module — responsibilities & ticks

Core loop

Sync & scope: fetch default branch, detect changed files (since last successful run).

Rebuild indexes: ripgrep/ctags + (optional) LSP snapshot. 
GitHub
docs.ctags.io
Microsoft GitHub

Static analyze: ESLint/Pylint/Roslyn/Sonar as applicable. 
Unity Discussions
Conventional Commits
typedoc.org
GitHub

Reasoning pass (LLM):

Summarize code deltas and risks.

Generate review checklist & suggested refactors.

Identify doc/API gaps.

Docs pass: run doc generators (DocFX/TypeDoc/Sphinx/Doxygen), then Vale + markdownlint. 
GitHub
+1
LangChain
CrewAI
Microsoft GitHub
vale.sh

Output

If code changes suggested: open PR(s) labeled analyst/refactor with diffs + justification.

If docs updates: open docs/update PR with regenerated API, refreshed guides, and a “What changed?” page.

If research decision needed: open/append a Design Note issue tagging Research Lab.

Triggers

On every PR (lightweight analysis + docs delta comments)

Nightly (full graph + doc rebuild)

On demand via make analyst or npm run analyst

8) Minimal examples you can drop in

A) MCP server config (exposing tools)

// .ai/mcp/local-tools.json
{
  "name": "local-tools",
  "command": "bash",
  "args": ["-lc", "exec mcp-local"],
  "tools": [
    { "name": "rg_search", "description": "ripgrep search", "schema": { "pattern":"string","path":"string" } },
    { "name": "ctags_lookup", "description": "find symbol", "schema": { "symbol":"string" } },
    { "name": "build_docs", "description": "run doc generation", "schema": { "scope":"string" } },
    { "name": "run_lint", "description": "lint code/docs", "schema": { "target":"string" } }
  ]
}


(Back your mcp-local script with actual calls to rg, ctags, DocFX/TypeDoc, Vale/markdownlint, etc. Those are the capabilities the agents will invoke.)

B) Docs CI gate (MkDocs example)

# .github/workflows/docs.yml
name: Docs
on: [pull_request, push]
jobs:
  build-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      - run: pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
      - run: npm i -g markdownlint-cli
      - run: curl -L https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases/latest/download/vale_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz | tar xz && sudo mv vale /usr/local/bin/
      - run: markdownlint '**/*.md' --ignore node_modules
      - run: vale docs/
      - run: mkdocs build --strict


(MkDocs/Docusaurus both support clean Markdown workflows and route mapping. 
mkdocs.org
docusaurus.io
)

C) Governance (snippets)

# CODEOWNERS (docs first)
docs/**          @docs-team
*.md             @docs-team
**/*.cs          @engine-csharp
**/*.{ts,tsx}    @engine-web


Enable Protected Branches → require status checks + review(s) and (optionally) Require review from Code Owners. 
GitHub Docs
+1

9) How the other teams plug in

Research Lab produces design memos/ADRs in docs/guides/decisions/. Analyst ingests these, links to code paths (via ctags/LSP), and proposes impact plans.

Implementers take the acceptance-tagged PRs or tasks. Their PRs get auto-requested to relevant CODEOWNERS and the Docs owner when public APIs or behaviors change. 
GitHub Docs

10) Suggested phased rollout

Phase 1 (1–2 days):
Ripgrep + ctags + Vale + markdownlint wired under MCP; agent can answer “where is X?” and “what changed?” and open docs-only PRs. 
GitHub
+1
docs.ctags.io
vale.sh

Phase 2:
Add language LSP(s) and static analyzers; start proposing safe refactors with tests; turn on branch protections and CODEOWNERS enforcement. 
Microsoft GitHub
Unity Discussions
Conventional Commits

Phase 3:
DocFX/TypeDoc/Sphinx/Doxygen autogen + site deploy previews on PRs; nightly full rebuild & drift report. 
GitHub
LangChain
CrewAI
Microsoft GitHub

Phase 4:
Introduce the Research Lab team; orchestrate with LangGraph or AutoGen; store per-team memories; add performance/size guardrails for large repos. 
GitHub
+1

Why this works well

You lean on deterministic local indexes (rg/ctags/LSP) for speed and precision, then let the agent reason and write. 
GitHub
docs.ctags.io
Microsoft GitHub

You treat docs as code with CI gatings (Vale, markdownlint) and a real site pipeline. 
vale.sh
GitHub

You standardize tool access with MCP, so either agent frontend (Claude Code, Cursor) can use the same capabilities — and you can swap frontends later without re-plumbing. 
Model Context Protocol
Anthropic
Cursor

You keep humans in the loop from day one via protected branches and CODEOWNERS. 
GitHub Docs

If you want, I can tailor the exact scripts for your current stack (Unity/C#, TS tools, GH Actions). I’ll default to DocFX for Unity C# API docs and MkDocs-Material for guides, and wire them through MCP so both Claude Code and Cursor can drive the same local toolbelt.

would autogen or langgraph be better for this project? 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 24s

Short answer: use LangGraph as the backbone, and embed AutoGen “group chats” as pluggable subroutines where brainstorming/collab is the point.

Why:

Process control & recovery. LangGraph gives you first-class, durable state via checkpointers (SQLite/Redis, etc.), which enables pause/resume, time-travel debugging, HITL approvals, and fault-tolerant long runs—exactly what you want for repo analysis, docs generation, and multi-team handoffs. 
LangChain

Production orchestration. It’s built for stateful, multi-agent graphs (conditional routing, retries, guards) and has solid patterns and cloud examples for running in prod.

Agent collaboration primitives. Its GroupChat pattern is perfect for your “Research Lab” team (ideation, alternative designs, ADR drafts) before results flow back to the LangGraph pipeline.

Rapid prototyping. Fast to stand up specialized agents for focused conversations; easy to iterate and then wrap the best of it as a deterministic step in the graph.

Recommended split of responsibilities

LangGraph (top-level):
Orchestrate the whole loop: scan repo → build code graph → run static checks → generate/refresh docs → open PRs → wait for review/merge; persist state across failures; require HITL at risky steps. 
LangChain
+1

AutoGen (inside specific LangGraph nodes):

“Research alternatives” huddle; 2) “Draft design memo/ADR”; 3) “Rewrite docs section” collaborations—then hand a concrete artifact back to the graph for linting, tests, and gating. 
Microsoft GitHub

Fit with your current system

You already have a Bootstrap Orchestrator and event-driven triggers; the LangGraph-as-backbone model maps neatly onto that (LangGraph = workflow brain; your Bootstrap = process launcher/health checks). 
 

When to flip the choice

Pick AutoGen end-to-end only if the centerpiece is collaborative conversation (many agents riffing) and you don’t need durable execution, HITL checkpoints, or complex routing. Otherwise, LangGraph will save you pain once the system is long-running and PR-gated. 
TrueFoundry

Bottom line: LangGraph for the spine; AutoGen for the “brainstorm rooms.” That gives you durable, auditable workflows for analysis + docs, with bursty collaboration where it actually helps.

What would the mcp be used for?

Great follow-up — here’s where MCP (Model Context Protocol) comes in for your project.

What MCP is

MCP is basically a standard way to expose local tools, data, and APIs to LLMs (Claude Code CLI, Cursor CLI, or any other agent) through a thin server.
Instead of agents guessing at shell commands or scraping files directly, you give them explicit, typed capabilities.

Why you’d use MCP in your system

For your Repo Analyst + Docs module, MCP is the safe interface layer between the agents and the project:

Expose repo inspection tools

rg_search → run ripgrep across the repo.

ctags_lookup → jump to symbol definitions.

git_diff → return clean diff chunks.

lint_run → call ESLint/Pylint/Roslyn analyzers.
These all become first-class tools the agent can invoke.

Expose build & test commands

build_project → call dotnet build, npm run build, etc.

run_tests → run test suites, return structured results.
Keeps agents from firing arbitrary shell commands.

Expose documentation pipelines

generate_docs → run DocFX, TypeDoc, Sphinx, or Doxygen.

lint_docs → run Vale + markdownlint.

publish_preview → output a URL for doc previews.

Expose metadata / context

list_changed_files → what changed since last run.

get_codegraph → load the prebuilt symbol/refs index.

get_build_logs → fetch logs for summarization.

Benefits

Standardized, re-usable across agents. Both Claude Code CLI and Cursor CLI speak MCP, so you don’t duplicate integrations — one toolbelt works for both.

Safety. Instead of “agent runs bash commands,” you constrain it to approved MCP tools with defined schemas.

Auditability. Every tool call is structured JSON; you can log who invoked what and why.

Extensibility. You can add project-specific helpers later (e.g. Unity editor automation, CI/CD status checks) as new MCP tools.

In your architecture

LangGraph / AutoGen orchestrator sits on top.

Agents (analyst, research, implementers) call capabilities.

MCP server(s) provide those capabilities (repo inspection, docs generation, builds, tests).

So the MCP layer is the bridge between the LLM agents and your actual project environment.

👉 Do you want me to sketch a concrete MCP toolbelt JSON config for your repo (say with rg, ctags, git diff, docfx, and vale) so you can see exactly how the agents would invoke them?

would it be better to upgrade powershell from 5.1?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 21s

Short answer: yes—install PowerShell 7 (side-by-side) and keep 5.1 for legacy bits. It’ll make your repo-analysis + docs agents more reliable (UTF-8, SSH remoting, better performance), while you can still call 5.1-only modules via the built-in compatibility shim.

Why upgrade (for your use-case)

UTF-8 everywhere by default → fewer “weird emoji/diacritics” breakages in scripts and logs. 
Microsoft Learn

Predictive IntelliSense (PSReadLine) and better tab completion → faster interactive triage. (Easy to turn off if you dislike it.)

SSH remoting first-class → clean cross-platform sessions (nice for Termius/WSL workflows). 
Microsoft Learn

Modern lifecycle + security → 7.4 is LTS; 7.5.x is current. 5.1 is “in Windows,” but new features target 7.x.

“But my module only works on 5.1…”

Use the Windows PowerShell Compatibility feature from 7.x:

# In PowerShell 7
Import-Module -UseWindowsPowerShell SomeLegacyModule


That spins up a 5.1 runspace under the hood (implicit remoting) so you can keep using older modules without dropping back to 5.1 for the whole session. Know the limits (Windows-only, serialized objects). 
Microsoft Learn

If needed, the WindowsCompatibility helper module is still available (Install-Module WindowsCompatibility). 
GitHub

Practical install & migration tips

Install side-by-side (don’t remove 5.1):

winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget


Then launch pwsh (new shell). 
Microsoft Learn

Make pwsh your default shell in Windows Terminal; keep a 5.1 profile for fallback.

Encoding sanity: even in 7.x, be explicit when writing files that other tools read:

Set-Content file.txt $text -Encoding utf8


(7.x defaults are saner, but being explicit avoids surprises.) 
Microsoft Learn

Turn off predictions if you don’t like them:

Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource None

SSH remoting (useful for your Termius workflows):

Enter-PSSession -HostName myhost -User georg -SSHTransport


Follow the setup guide if you haven’t enabled the OpenSSH subsystem yet.

Version choice right now

7.4 (LTS) if you want a longer support window.

7.5.x if you want the newest features; 7.5.2 is the latest patch as of June 24, 2025. 
endoflife.date

Bottom line

Move your agent runners and CI to PowerShell 7 for encoding stability, SSH, and speed; keep 5.1 installed for the few Windows-only modules and call them via the compatibility layer. That gives you the best of both worlds with minimal disruption.
