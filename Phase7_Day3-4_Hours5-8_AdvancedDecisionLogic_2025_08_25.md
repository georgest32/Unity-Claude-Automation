### Technical Implementation Details

#### Bayesian Framework Structure
```powershell
$script:BayesianConfig = @{
    PriorProbabilities = @{
        CONTINUE = 0.5
        TEST = 0.3
        FIX = 0.15
        ERROR = 0.05
    }
    UpdateRate = 0.1
    MinimumSamples = 10
    ConfidenceBands = @{
        High = 0.95
        Medium = 0.8
        Low = 0.6
    }
}
```

#### Circuit Breaker States
```powershell
$script:CircuitBreakerStates = @{
    Closed = "Normal operation"
    Open = "Blocking all requests"
    HalfOpen = "Testing recovery"
}
```

### Files Modified
1. `Modules\Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator\Core\DecisionEngine.psm1` - Enhanced with Bayesian logic
