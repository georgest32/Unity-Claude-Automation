**Topics Involved**: PowerShell constrained runspace, command whitelisting, parameter sanitization, Unity automation security

## Home State Analysis

### Current Implementation Status
- **Project Root**: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation\
- **Unity Version**: 2021.1.14f1 (.NET Standard 2.0)
- **PowerShell**: 5.1 compatibility maintained throughout
- **Current Phase**: Claude Code CLI Autonomous Agent Phase 1 Day 3

### Foundation Completed (Days 1-2)
**Day 1 Infrastructure**:
- ✅ Unity-Claude-AutonomousAgent.psm1 module (v1.1.1, 27 functions)
- ✅ Thread-safe logging with System.Threading.Mutex
- ✅ FileSystemWatcher with real-time detection and debouncing
- ✅ Basic command queue management with ThreadJob integration

**Day 2 Intelligence Layer**:
- ✅ Enhanced regex parsing with 4 pattern types (100% accuracy)
- ✅ Response classification for 5 response types (100% accuracy)
- ✅ Context extraction for Unity errors, files, and technical terms
- ✅ Conversation state detection with autonomous operation assessment
- ✅ Confidence scoring algorithm with dynamic assessment

### Long and Short Term Objectives

**Mission Statement**: Create intelligent, self-improving automation system that bridges Unity compilation errors with Claude's problem-solving capabilities

**Day 3 Specific Goals**:
1. **Constrained Runspace Security** - Create isolated execution environment with whitelisted cmdlets only
2. **Command Validation Framework** - Prevent command injection through parameter sanitization
3. **Unity-Specific Security** - Safe Unity.exe execution with parameter validation
4. **Resource Protection** - Timeout enforcement and resource limit controls
5. **Path Boundary Enforcement** - Restrict operations to project directory only

**Benchmarks for Day 3**:
- Constrained runspace blocks all dangerous cmdlets (Invoke-Expression, Add-Type with code)
- Parameter validation prevents special character injection
- Unity command execution isolated with timeout protection
- All file operations restricted to project boundaries
- Zero security vulnerabilities in command execution

### Current System Dependencies

**From Important Learnings (Critical Context)**:
- **Learning #98**: Unity Start-Process hanging prevention required (use -PassThru, not -Wait)
- **Learning #102**: PowerShell module manifest RootModule requirement
- **Learning #96**: System.Threading.Mutex for thread-safe operations

**Research Findings Available**:
- Constrained runspace creation with InitialSessionState.Create()
- PowerShell 5.1 command whitelisting patterns
- Parameter validation and sanitization techniques
- Unity 2021.1.14f1 command line automation requirements

### Implementation Priority

**Core Components for Day 3**:
1. **Constrained Runspace Factory** - Create secure execution environments
2. **Command Whitelist Manager** - Define and enforce allowed cmdlets
3. **Parameter Validation Engine** - Sanitize and validate all inputs
4. **Unity Command Wrapper** - Safe Unity.exe execution with hanging prevention
5. **Security Boundary Enforcement** - Path validation and resource limits

## Research Findings (5 Queries Completed)

### 1. PowerShell 5.1 Constrained Runspace and InitialSessionState
**Key Discoveries**:
- InitialSessionState.Create() creates empty state with only specified commands
- SessionStateCmdletEntry class defines whitelisted cmdlets for security
- Using constrained runspace provides significantly improved performance
- Commands can be marked private for internal use only

**Implementation Pattern**:
```powershell
$iss = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.InitialSessionState]::Create()
$cmdletEntry = New-Object System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.SessionStateCmdletEntry("Get-Content", [Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetContentCommand], $null)
$iss.Commands.Add($cmdletEntry)
$runspace = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspaceFactory]::CreateRunspace($iss)
```

### 2. Parameter Validation and Command Injection Prevention
**Security Techniques**:
- ValidateSet, ValidateLength, ValidatePattern attributes for parameter validation
- Avoid Invoke-Expression - use parameter binding instead
- Single quotes around user input for literal string protection
- Whitelist validation over blacklist for input filtering

**Critical Protections**:
- PowerShell parser provides intrinsic protection against malicious code injection
- Parameter binding validates input without text replacement and re-parsing
- Built-in validation attributes enforce security rules automatically

### 3. Unity Command Line Security and Path Validation
**Unity-Specific Requirements**:
- -projectPath defines project boundaries for safe operation
- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- -executeMethod allows controlled Unity method execution
- Build output paths require validation for security

**Security Considerations**:
- Unity command line args not accessible after build for security
- Full path specification required for external executables
- Editor folder requirement for -executeMethod security

### 4. PowerShell Runspace Timeout and Resource Limits
**Timeout Implementation**:
- Manual timeout tracking with DateTime comparison
- System.Timers.Timer for automatic runspace termination
- Runspace pool throttling for resource management
- Proper disposal to prevent memory leaks

**Isolation Benefits**:
- Variable isolation between runspaces prevents contamination
- Each runspace operates in isolated space with clean slate
- Session state management prevents interference

### 5. SessionStateCmdletEntry Safe Execution Framework
**Whitelisted Command Implementation**:
- SessionStateCmdletEntry defines specific cmdlets with type and visibility
- InitialSessionState.Commands.Add() method for adding whitelisted commands
- Command visibility controls (Public/Private) for security
- Constrained runspace endpoint for controlled remote execution

**Enterprise Security Pattern**:
- Allows specific administrative tasks without full admin access
- Prevents access to dangerous commands while enabling necessary functionality
- Performance optimization through selective command loading
