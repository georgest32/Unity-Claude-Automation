- Human-readable for debugging
- No external DLL dependencies
- Easier deployment in restricted environments

### 3. Automated Command Execution Risks
**Security Research Findings**:
- Command injection vulnerabilities (OWASP top risk)
- Industry best practice: "Never call out to OS commands from application-layer code"
- Current manual approval maintains necessary human oversight

### 4. Git Rollback Concerns
**Unity-Specific Issues**:
- Binary asset management complexity
- Manual commits provide better developer oversight
- Automated commits risk including sensitive data
- Current file-based backup system is sufficient

## Preliminary Solutions Analysis

**Root Finding**: Current implementation is superior to originally planned enhancements

**Revised Focus Areas**:
1. **Enhanced Centralized Logging** - Improve the existing unity_claude_automation.log system
2. **Log Archival System** - Implement automatic log rotation and historical retention
3. **Cross-Module Integration** - Ensure all modules log to central file consistently
4. **Log Analysis Tools** - Basic text-based tools for log searching and analysis

## Revised Implementation Approach

**Philosophy**: Simplicity, Security, and Maintainability over Feature Complexity

**Key Principles**:
- Use native PowerShell capabilities where possible
- Avoid external dependencies that don't provide significant value
- Maintain PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
- Prioritize security and developer control over automation

- 7-day default retention policy common practice
- Location separate from production for security
- Standardized log format improves analysis capabilities

### 2. Log Rotation and File Size Management
**Technical Approaches**:
- Size-based rotation (e.g., 1GB max file size)
- Function-based rotation with counter increment
- Scheduled rotation with timestamp naming
- Compression integration for space efficiency

**Best Practices**:
- Monitor file size before writing logs
- Use standardized filename patterns with timestamps
- Configure maximum log count for retention
- Implement automatic cleanup of oldest logs

### 3. PowerShell Module Logging Standardization
**Solutions Available**:
- PSLogging module for standardization across scripts
- Mutex-based approach for concurrent script access
- Custom logging functions in shared .psm1 files
- Structured logging with Serilog framework

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Central log file accessible from multiple modules
- Standardized log entry format across all scripts
- Thread-safe logging for concurrent operations
- Common logging function library approach

### 4. Enterprise Log Archival and Compression
**Automation Strategies**:
- Compress-Archive cmdlet for PowerShell 5.1+
- Automated age-based compression (e.g., >30 days)
- Scheduling via Task Scheduler for routine cleanup
- Email notifications for archival activities

**Storage Optimization**:
- Compression reduces storage by 60-80%
- Date-based organization for easy retrieval
- Configurable retention policies by log type
- Performance vs size trade-offs (Fastest vs Optimal)

### 5. PowerShell 5.1 Performance Optimization
