# Day 13 CLI Automation - Final Debug Session
*Date: 2025-01-18 | Type: Test Results/Debugging | Resolution: Partial*
*Previous: Queue management fixes | Topics: Queue sorting, SendKeys targeting, test consistency*

## Initial Test Results
- **Success Rate**: 94.44% (17/18 tests passed)
- **Failed Tests**: 1 functional failure (queue prioritization)
- **Secondary Issue**: Duration property calculation error

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: SendKeys Typing into PowerShell Console âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Word "test" appearing in PowerShell input after test execution
**Root Cause**: Get-ClaudeWindow function searching PowerShell processes
**Fix**: Removed PowerShell processes from search, require explicit Claude title match
**Files Modified**: CLIAutomation.psm1 (Get-ClaudeWindow function)
**Learning Added**: #131 - SendKeys Target Window Detection Issue

### Issue 2: Duration Property Missing in Failed Tests âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: "Duration property cannot be found" error in performance calculation
**Root Cause**: Failed test results missing Duration property
**Fix**: Added Duration property to failed test result structure
**Files Modified**: Test-CLIAutomation-Day13.ps1 (Test-CLIFunction catch block)
**Learning Added**: #132 - Test Duration Property Missing in Failed Tests

### Issue 3: Queue Prioritization Test Failure ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Problem**: Queue not sorted by priority (test failing)
**Analysis**: Added debug logging to trace sorting behavior
**Debug Added**: 
- Priority values before and after sorting in Add-InputToQueue
- Actual vs expected priorities display in test
**Status**: Debug tools added, awaiting test execution to analyze

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Claude Window Detection
```powershell
# Before: Searched PowerShell processes too
$processNames = @("claude", "WindowsTerminal", "pwsh", "powershell", "cmd", "conhost")

# After: Claude-specific first, terminals only with explicit Claude title
$claudeProcesses = Get-Process -Name "claude" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Only accept terminals with "claude" in title
```

### 2. Consistent Test Result Structure
```powershell
# Added Duration to failed tests
$script:TestResults += @{
    Test = $TestName
    Category = $Category
    Status = "FAIL"
    Duration = $duration  # Added this line
    Error = $_.ToString()
}
```

### 3. Queue Sorting Debug Logging
```powershell
# Debug logging for queue sorting
$beforePriorities = ($queueArray | ForEach-Object { $_.Priority }) -join ', '
Write-CLILog "Before sorting: $beforePriorities"
$queue.Queue = $queueArray | Sort-Object -Property Priority -Descending
$afterPriorities = ($queue.Queue | ForEach-Object { $_.Priority }) -join ', '
Write-CLILog "After sorting: $afterPriorities"
```

### 4. Test Debug Output
```powershell
# Debug output for troubleshooting
Write-Host "    Actual priorities: $($priorities -join ', ')" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "    Expected priorities: $($sorted -join ', ')" -ForegroundColor Gray
```

## Expected Results After Fixes
1. **SendKeys Issue**: No more typing into PowerShell console
2. **Duration Error**: Performance summary should calculate correctly
3. **Queue Sorting**: Debug output will show what's happening with priorities

## Files Modified
1. **CLIAutomation.psm1** - Improved window detection and added queue debug logging
2. **Test-CLIAutomation-Day13.ps1** - Fixed Duration property and added debug output
3. **IMPORTANT_LEARNINGS.md** - Added learnings #131, #132
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Added hotfix notes
5. **unity_claude_automation.log** - Logged debug session

## Next Steps
1. Run tests to validate SendKeys and Duration fixes
2. Analyze queue sorting debug output to identify root cause
3. Fix queue prioritization issue based on debug analysis
4. Verify 100% test success rate

## Outstanding Questions
- Why is queue sorting not working correctly with Sort-Object?
- Are PSObject properties from JSON affecting sorting behavior?
- Need to verify if Priority property is being preserved correctly through JSON roundtrip
