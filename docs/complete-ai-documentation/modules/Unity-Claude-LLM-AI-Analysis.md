1. Module purpose and functionality: The Ollama LLM Integration module is designed to integrate the Enhanced Documentation System with the Ollama Local Language Model (LLM) for code generation and documentation enhancement. It provides a set of PowerShell functions that enable developers to interact with the Ollama API, generate documentation, and perform AI-assisted predictive analysis.
2. Key functions and capabilities: The module includes several key functions that enable developers to use the Ollama LLM for code generation and documentation enhancement. These include `Test-OllamaConnection`, which tests the connection to the Ollama API, `Get-OllamaModels`, which retrieves a list of available models from the Ollama API, and `Invoke-OllamaGenerate`, which generates documentation using the selected model. Additionally, the module provides support for AI-assisted predictive analysis through the use of the `Test-OllamaPredict` function.
3. Integration with Enhanced Documentation System: The Ollama LLM Integration module is designed to work seamlessly with the Enhanced Documentation System, providing a powerful toolset for developers to generate high-quality documentation quickly and efficiently. By integrating the Ollama LLM with the Enhanced Documentation System, developers can create more accurate and comprehensive documentation, which can help improve productivity and reduce errors.
4. AI and predictive analysis features (if applicable): The module includes support for AI-assisted predictive analysis through the use of the `Test-OllamaPredict` function. This function enables developers to test the accuracy of the Ollama LLM by providing a prompt and receiving a prediction from the model. Additionally, the module provides support for AI-assisted code completion through the use of the `Invoke-OllamaGenerate` function.
5. Usage examples for documentation teams: The Ollama LLM Integration module can be used by any documentation team to improve the quality and speed of their documentation generation process. Here are some usage examples:
* Developers can use the `Test-OllamaConnection` function to test the connection to the Ollama API before generating documentation.
* Documentation teams can use the `Get-OllamaModels` function to retrieve a list of available models from the Ollama API and select the appropriate model for their needs.
* Developers can use the `Invoke-OllamaGenerate` function to generate high-quality documentation quickly and efficiently, using the selected model.
* Documentation teams can use the `Test-OllamaPredict` function to test the accuracy of the Ollama LLM by providing a prompt and receiving a prediction from the model. This can help improve the quality of the generated documentation and reduce errors.; Model=codellama:13b; Done=True; TotalDuration=11253472400; LoadDuration=10629200; PromptEvalCount=839; PromptEvalDuration=460459000; EvalCount=598; EvalDuration=10781636900}
