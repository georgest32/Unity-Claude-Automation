2. **Temporal Evolution**:
   - Show how relationships change over time
   - Visualize code evolution patterns
   - Display growth and complexity trends
   
3. **Interactive Exploration**:
   - Enable drill-down into module relationships
   - Show function-level dependencies
   - Provide AI-enhanced relationship explanations

### Priority 3: Real-time Intelligence (MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Transform from static analysis to living, intelligent documentation system

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **File System Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time file change detection
   - Trigger automatic analysis on code changes
   - Update documentation and visualizations live
   
2. **Continuous AI Analysis**:
   - Run background AI analysis on code changes
   - Provide immediate feedback and suggestions
   - Generate proactive maintenance recommendations
   
3. **Intelligent Alerting**:
   - AI-powered alerts for code quality issues
   - Predictive warnings for maintenance needs
   - Automated recommendations for improvements

## ENHANCED RELATIONSHIP MAPPING FOR VISUALIZATION

To fix the visualization relationships, implement:

### 1. Function Call Analysis
`powershell
# Analyze function calls between all modules
foreach (C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation\Modules\Unity-TestAutomation\Unity-TestAutomation.psm1 in ) {
    # Extract all function calls and map to source modules
    # Create rich link data showing actual usage relationships
}
`

### 2. Import/Export Relationship Mapping
`powershell  
# Map all Import-Module statements to actual dependencies
# Track Export-ModuleMember to show what functions are available
# Create dependency strength based on usage frequency
`

### 3. Week 4 Integration Enhancement
`powershell
# Show how Week 4 predictive modules enhance all other components
# Map data flow from core analysis through predictive enhancement
# Visualize AI service integration points
`
