## Learning #230: PowerShell Module Nesting Limit - Critical Fix
**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Impact**: HIGH - Prevents refactored modules from loading  
**Category**: Module Architecture

### Issue
PowerShell has a hard limit of 10 levels for module nesting. When refactoring large monolithic modules into component-based architecture, using Import-Module for each component can exceed this limit, causing complete failure to load.

### Discovery
- Refactored OrchestrationManager.psm1 (978 lines) into 4 components
- Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator.psd1 loads 9 NestedModules
- OrchestrationManager-Refactored.psm1 tried to Import-Module 4 more components
- Result: "Cannot load the module... module nesting limit has been exceeded"

### Solution
Convert from Import-Module to dot-sourcing for component loading:

```powershell
# WRONG - Exceeds nesting limit
Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\Components\Component1.psm1"

# CORRECT - Dot-sourcing avoids nesting
. "$PSScriptRoot\Components\Component1.psm1"
```

### Implementation Pattern
```powershell
# For refactored modules with components
$componentPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "Components"
$components = @("Component1.psm1", "Component2.psm1")

foreach ($component in $components) {
    $componentFile = Join-Path $componentPath $component
    if (Test-Path $componentFile) {
        . $componentFile  # Dot-source instead of Import-Module
    }
}

# Export functions normally
Export-ModuleMember -Function @('Function1', 'Function2')
```

### Critical Learning
- Always check module nesting depth when refactoring
- Use dot-sourcing for component-based architecture
- PowerShell manifest NestedModules count toward the limit
- Monitor for "module nesting limit exceeded" errors
- Consider flat module structures for complex systems

## Learning #231: Test Signal File Re-processing Prevention
**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Impact**: HIGH - Causes infinite test execution loops  
**Category**: Orchestration Logic

### Issue
Test completion signal files were being processed repeatedly in every monitoring cycle, causing tests to run continuously even after successful completion.

### Root Cause
The monitoring loop only filtered signal files by LastWriteTime > $startTime, with no mechanism to track which signals had already been processed. Each monitoring cycle would re-process the same signal files.

### Solution
Mark signal files as processed after handling them:

```powershell
# Filter out already processed signal files
$signalFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $responseDir -Filter "TestComplete_*.signal" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
               Where-Object { 
                   $_.LastWriteTime -gt $startTime -and 
                   -not (Test-Path "$($_.FullName).processed") 
               } |
               Sort-Object LastWriteTime

# After processing, mark as complete
$processedMarkerFile = "$($signalFile.FullName).processed"
"Processed at $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')" | Set-Content -Path $processedMarkerFile -Force
```

### Critical Learning
- Always implement idempotency in monitoring loops
- Track processed items to prevent re-processing
- Use marker files or state tracking for completion
- Consider cleanup of old processed markers periodically

## Learning #232: Claude Window Detection Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Impact**: HIGH - Incorrect window detection causes commands to go to wrong application  
**Category**: Window Management

### Issue
The CLI Orchestrator was incorrectly detecting any PowerShell window as the Claude CLI window, causing TypeKeys commands to be sent to the wrong application. The fallback logic would use the first available PowerShell window even if Claude wasn't running in it.

### Root Cause
1. Overly aggressive fallback logic that selected any PowerShell window
2. No command-line argument checking to verify Claude is actually running
3. Generic title patterns that matched non-Claude windows

### Solution
Enhanced window detection with multiple strategies:

```powershell
# Method 1: Check command line arguments using WMI/CIM
$allProcesses = Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$claudeProcesses = $allProcesses | Where-Object { 
    $_.CommandLine -and ($_.CommandLine -match 'claude' -or $_.CommandLine -match 'anthropic')
}

# Method 2: More specific title patterns (no generic fallbacks)
$claudeOnlyPatterns = @(
    "*Claude Code CLI*",                     
    "*claude*code*",                         
    "*claude*cli*",                          
    "*claude chat*",                         
    "*- claude*",                            
    "Administrator:*claude*",                
    "*anthropic*"                            
)

# NO FALLBACK - Return null if Claude not found
if (-not $claudeWindow) {
    Write-Host "CRITICAL: No Claude window found!" -ForegroundColor Red
    return $null
}
```

### Helper Script
Created `Set-ClaudeWindowTitle.ps1` to help users identify their Claude CLI window:

```powershell
# Sets window title for easy detection
$host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = "Claude Code CLI environment"

# Also updates system_status.json with window info
```

### Critical Learning
- Never use generic fallbacks for window detection
- Check process command lines for better identification
- Provide clear user guidance when detection fails
- Create helper tools to simplify window identification
- Return null instead of wrong window to fail fast
