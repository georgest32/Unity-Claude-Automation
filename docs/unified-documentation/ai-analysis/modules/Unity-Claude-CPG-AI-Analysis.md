@{Success=True; Response=Module Purpose:
The Core Code Property Graph module is a PowerShell module that provides a comprehensive code property graph structure for relationship mapping and code analysis. It merges AST, CFG, and PDG for better code understanding and obsolescence detection. The module is designed to be used with the Enhanced Documentation System v2.0.0.

Key Functions:
The Core Code Property Graph module provides the following key functions:

1. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) conversion: The module can convert code into an AST, which is a tree-like structure that represents the syntax of the code.
2. CFG (Control Flow Graph) creation: The module can create a CFG for a given code snippet or file, which shows the control flow of the code.
3. PDG (Program Dependence Graph) creation: The module can create a PDG for a given code snippet or file, which shows the dependencies between different parts of the code.
4. Code analysis and relationship mapping: The module can perform various analyses on the AST, CFG, and PDG to identify relationships between different parts of the code.
5. Obsolescence detection: The module can detect obsolete code by analyzing the dependencies between different parts of the code and identifying any unnecessary or redundant code.

Capabilities:
The Core Code Property Graph module has the following capabilities:

1. AST conversion: The module can convert code into an AST, which is a tree-like structure that represents the syntax of the code.
2. CFG creation: The module can create a CFG for a given code snippet or file, which shows the control flow of the code.
3. PDG creation: The module can create a PDG for a given code snippet or file, which shows the dependencies between different parts of the code.
4. Code analysis and relationship mapping: The module can perform various analyses on the AST, CFG, and PDG to identify relationships between different parts of the code.
5. Obsolescence detection: The module can detect obsolete code by analyzing the dependencies between different parts of the code and identifying any unnecessary or redundant code.
6. Integration with Enhanced Documentation System v2.0.0: The Core Code Property Graph module is designed to be used with the Enhanced Documentation System v2.0.0, which provides a comprehensive documentation solution for software development teams.
