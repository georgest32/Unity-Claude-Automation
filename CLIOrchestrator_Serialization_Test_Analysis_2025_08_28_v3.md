# CLIOrchestrator Serialization Test Analysis - Third Run
**Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Time:** 13:01 PM (Third Test Run)  
**Previous Context:** Triple validation of CLIOrchestrator serialization fix for path corruption issue  
**Topics:** PowerShell serialization, object-to-string conversion, reliability validation, production readiness  
**Problem:** Final confirmation that serialization fix maintains consistent behavior across multiple test iterations  

## Analysis Overview

This third test run of the CLIOrchestrator serialization test represents the final reliability validation for the critical serialization fix. The primary focus is confirming that the implementation maintains 100% consistency across multiple test iterations, validating production readiness for autonomous operation.

## Test Context and Previous Results

### Previous Test Runs Summary
1. **First Run (12:41 PM)**: Initial validation showing 8/8 tests passed, 5.06-second execution
2. **Second Run (12:56 PM)**: Consistency confirmation with identical results to first run  
3. **Third Run (13:01 PM)**: Final reliability validation - this analysis

### Critical Serialization Issue Background
- **Root Problem**: Complex PowerShell objects in prompt generation were displaying as `@{key=System.Object[]}` instead of actual file paths
- **Impact**: Corrupted prompts being submitted to Claude Code CLI, preventing proper autonomous operation
