# CLIOrchestrator Testing Flow Debug Analysis
**Date**: 2025-08-27
**Time**: 11:15:00
**Issue**: Testing prompt-type not executing tests from JSON recommendations
**Previous Context**: CLIOrchestrator module corruption fixed, JSON detection working
**Topics**: Unity-Claude-Automation, PowerShell, FileSystemWatcher, Test Execution

## Home State
- Project: Unity-Claude-Automation PowerShell framework
- Module: Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator
- Location: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation
- PowerShell Version: 5.1/7.x
- Current Task: Debug Testing prompt-type execution flow

## Project Structure
- Core modules in Modules\Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator\
- Test files in project root
- JSON files in ClaudeResponses\Autonomous\
- Logs in AutomationLogs\

## Current Implementation Status
- JSON detection: Working via FileSystemWatcher
- Pattern recognition: Working (Find-RecommendationPatterns)
- Decision making: Working (Invoke-RuleBasedDecision)
- Test execution: NOT WORKING (placeholder implementation)
- Window switching: Function exists (Switch-ToWindow)
- TypeKeys submission: Function exists (Submit-ToClaudeViaTypeKeys)

## Error Flow Analysis
1. JSON file created with Testing recommendation
2. FileSystemWatcher detects new JSON
3. Response text extracted correctly
4. Pattern recognized as TEST type
5. Decision made to EXECUTE
6. Invoke-DecisionExecution called
7. **FAILURE**: Function only has placeholder implementation
8. No test execution occurs
9. No results file created
10. No window switch or prompt submission

## Preliminary Solution
- Implement full Invoke-DecisionExecution function
- Add comprehensive logging at each step
- Handle test script execution
- Create results file
- Switch to Claude Code CLI window
- Submit results via TypeKeys
