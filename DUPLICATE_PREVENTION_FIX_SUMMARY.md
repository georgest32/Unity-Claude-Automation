# Duplicate Prevention Fix Summary
## Date: 2025-08-21

## Problem Identified
When the SystemStatus monitoring module was restarting AutonomousAgent, it was creating duplicate agents because of a PID mismatch issue:

1. `Start-AutonomousAgentSafe` would launch the agent script using `Start-Process`
2. It would register the PowerShell wrapper process PID (e.g., 48136)
3. The actual agent script would then self-register with its own PID (e.g., 59924)
4. This created confusion where the monitoring thought the agent wasn't running (checking wrong PID)
5. Multiple agents would end up running simultaneously

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed PID Registration Flow (Test-AutonomousAgentStatus.ps1)
- Modified `Start-AutonomousAgentSafe` to NOT overwrite the PID after starting
- Instead, it now waits for the agent to self-register with the correct PID
- Added verification that the self-registered process is actually running
- Better logging to distinguish between wrapper PID and actual agent PID

### 2. Preserved Duplicate Detection (Register-Subsystem.ps1)
The duplicate detection logic remains intact:
- When AutonomousAgent tries to register, it checks for existing registration
- If found, verifies if that process is still alive
- If alive, kills it before allowing new registration
- This ensures only one agent can run at a time

## Key Files Modified
1. `Modules\Unity-Claude-SystemStatus\Monitoring\Test-AutonomousAgentStatus.ps1`
   - Fixed `Start-AutonomousAgentSafe` function to wait for self-registration
   
2. `Start-AutonomousMonitoring-Fixed.ps1`
   - Added comments clarifying that $PID is correct when using -NoExit

## How It Works Now
1. SystemStatus monitor calls `Start-AutonomousAgentSafe`
2. Function launches agent script in new PowerShell window
3. Function waits for agent to self-register (up to 5 seconds)
4. Agent script registers itself with its actual PID via `Register-Subsystem`
5. `Register-Subsystem` checks for and kills any existing agent before registering
6. SystemStatus monitor verifies the registered PID is actually running

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `Test-DuplicatePrevention.ps1` - Basic duplicate prevention test
- `Test-DuplicatePrevention-Verbose.ps1` - Detailed test with logging

## Remaining Issue
The system_status.json file is sometimes written to the wrong location. This needs investigation but doesn't affect the duplicate prevention functionality.

## Verification
To verify duplicate prevention is working:
1. Start the SystemStatus monitor
2. Watch as it detects and restarts dead agents
3. Only one agent should ever be running
4. Check PIDs match between registration and actual process
