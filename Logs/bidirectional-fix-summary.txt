# Bidirectional Communication Fix Summary
Date: 2025-08-16

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Named Pipe Hanging Issue
**Problem**: The async pipe server was hanging when clients tried to connect
**Root Cause**: Background jobs couldn't access script-scoped variables
**Solution**: Implemented self-contained job script block that creates its own pipe server instance

### 2. Queue Management Null Reference
**Problem**: Queue operations were throwing null reference exceptions
**Root Cause**: Conditional variable assignment wasn't capturing script-scoped references properly
**Solution**: Changed to direct access pattern with if/else blocks

### 3. PowerShell String Terminator Errors
**Problem**: Scripts failing with "string is missing the terminator" errors
**Root Cause**: Complex string interpolations and corrupted Unicode characters
**Solution**: Simplified string handling and removed Unicode symbols

## Current Status

✅ **Working**:
- Named pipe server creation (async mode)
- Named pipe client communication
- Send/receive messages via pipes
- Queue management operations
- Module loading and initialization

⚠️ **Partially Working**:
- HTTP API server starts but health check hangs
- Status messages need JSON format update

❌ **Still Needs Work**:
- HTTP request handling in background jobs
- Full bidirectional flow integration
- WebSocket support (not implemented)

## Test Results
- Named Pipes: 2/3 tests passing (status check needs update)
- Queues: 6/6 tests passing
- HTTP API: Server starts but request handling needs fix

## Files Modified
1. Unity-Claude-IPC-Bidirectional.psm1 - Complete rewrite with fixed implementation
2. Test-BidirectionalCommunication.ps1 - Replaced with clean version
3. Created multiple test scripts for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Fix HTTP request handling in background jobs
2. Update status response format to JSON
3. Complete integration testing
4. Add WebSocket support (Phase 3)
