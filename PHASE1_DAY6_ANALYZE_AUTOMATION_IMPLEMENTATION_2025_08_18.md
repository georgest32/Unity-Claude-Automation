## Research Findings (5 Queries Completed)

### 1. Unity 2021.1.14f1 Log File Analysis
**Key Discoveries**:
- Unity 2021.1.14f1 uses Editor.log as primary log file (no separate Console.log)
- Log location: Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Unity\Editor\Editor.log`
- Log format: Plain text without built-in timestamps unless using CLI `-timestamps` flag
- Content includes: Console messages, Debug.Log output, warnings, errors, compilation results
- Critical: Unity adds all messages, warnings, and errors from Console window to log files

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Parser must handle plain text format with line-by-line analysis
- Error detection via regex patterns for CS error codes
- Performance metrics extraction from build and compilation timing
- Integration with Application.consoleLogPath property for dynamic log location

### 2. Unity Compilation Error Pattern Analysis
**Common Error Patterns for Unity 2021.1.14f1**:
- **CS0103**: "The name does not exist in the current context" (scope/declaration issues)
- **CS0246**: "The type or namespace name could not be found" (missing references)
- **CS1061**: "Type does not contain a definition for" (missing methods/properties)
- **CS0029**: "Cannot implicitly convert type" (type conversion errors)

**Regex Patterns**:
- General CS error: `error CS\d+:`
- Specific patterns: `error CS0246:.*could not be found`, `error CS0103:.*does not exist`
- File location extraction: `Assets/.*\.cs\(\d+,\d+\):`
- Severity classification: error vs warning patterns

### 3. PowerShell Report Generation Technologies
**ConvertTo-Html Capabilities**:
- Converts .NET objects to HTML for web display
- Parameters: Property selection, table/list format, title, custom CSS
- Advanced: Fragment generation, before/after text insertion
- Best practice: Use Select-Object before conversion for performance

**ConvertTo-Json Features**:
- Depth parameter (0-100, default 2) for nested object handling
- UTF-8 encoding support for international characters
- Compressed format option for smaller output
- Integration with web APIs and modern data exchange

**ConvertTo-Csv Capabilities**:
- Character-separated value output with customizable delimiters
- Header inclusion/exclusion options
- UTF-8 encoding for compatibility
- Works with Export-Csv for direct file output

### 4. PowerShell Performance Analysis and Timing
**Measure-Command Cmdlet**:
- Built-in timing tool returning TimeSpan objects
- Limitation: No stdout output (requires Out-Default piping)
- Best for: Simple command timing with minimal setup

**System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch Class**:
- High-resolution performance counter (more accurate than system clock)
- Methods: Start(), Stop(), Restart(), Reset()
- Properties: Elapsed, ElapsedMilliseconds, ElapsedTicks
- Advantages: Fine-grained control, discrete section timing, immune to clock adjustments

**Performance Analysis Best Practices**:
- Multiple iteration measurement for short operations
- Section-by-section timing for optimization identification
- Descriptive output for log analysis
- Baseline establishment for comparison

### 5. PowerShell Log Analysis and Pattern Detection
**Select-String Core Features**:
- Regular expression matching for text patterns in files
- Multiple pattern search with logical OR operator
- Context parameter for before/after line display
- Highlighting matches and storing results in variables

**File Monitoring Strategies**:
- Get-Content -Wait for real-time monitoring
