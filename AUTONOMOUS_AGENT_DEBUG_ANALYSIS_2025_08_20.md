# Autonomous Agent Debugging Analysis
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Time**: 11:53 AM
**Context**: Multiple issues with autonomous agent system after previous PID detection research

## Problem Summary

The autonomous agent system has multiple critical issues preventing proper operation:

1. **Incorrect Window Detection** - Agent finding wrong terminal window for Claude Code CLI
2. **Broken Mouse/Keyboard Locking** - Used to work, now non-functional  
3. **Fast Monitoring Loop** - Timing calculation error causing 6-8 second intervals reported as 30 seconds
4. **Window Title Mismatch** - Tab title vs window title consistency needed

## Current System State

### Project Context
- **Current Focus**: Phase 4 Advanced Features (Day 18 System Status Monitoring 95% complete)
- **Project**: Unity-Claude Automation (NOT Symbolic Memory)
- **Environment**: PowerShell 5.1, Unity 2021.1.14f1
- **Status**: Autonomous agent operational but with critical window detection issues

### Console Output Analysis (11:45-11:50)
```
AutonomousAgent Process ID: 41744
[CLISubmission] Found Claude Code CLI PID from system_status.json: 36760
[CLISubmission] Node.js process detected (PID: 36760), CANNOT use for keystrokes
[CLISubmission] Looking for PowerShell terminal window instead...
[CLISubmission] Found Claude terminal: Administrator: Windows PowerShell (PID: 5804)
[CLISubmission] Target window: Administrator: Windows PowerShell
[CLISubmission] Process: powershell (PID: 5804)

[11:46:08] Autonomous monitoring active (uptime: 30 seconds)
[11:46:14] Processing queued file: triggered_continue_20250820_114614.json  # Only 6 seconds later!
```

### Log File Analysis (unity_claude_automation.log)
- **Pattern**: MonitorLoop debug messages every 2 seconds (11:52:47, 11:52:49, 11:52:51)
- **SystemStatus**: Heartbeats every 30 seconds (11:52:20, 11:52:50, 11:53:20)
- **Issue**: Console reports wrong uptime calculation

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Wrong Window Detection
**Problem**: Agent detecting "Administrator: Windows PowerShell (PID: 5804)" instead of correct Claude Code CLI window
**Evidence**: 
- Console shows wrong window selection
- Previous research found correct window: "Claude Code CLI environment" (Handle: 1513774, PID: 57168)
- system_status.json has correct TerminalWindowHandle: "1513774"

**Root Cause**: CLISubmission module not using the TerminalWindowHandle from system_status.json

### Issue 2: Timing Calculation Error  
**Problem**: Monitoring loop reports 30-second intervals but actually running every 6-8 seconds
**Evidence**: 
- Console timestamps show 6-second gaps: [11:46:08] -> [11:46:14]
- Message claims "uptime: 30 seconds" but duration is 6 seconds
- Log shows actual 2-second MonitorLoop intervals

**Root Cause**: Uptime calculation logic error in monitoring system

### Issue 3: Mouse/Keyboard Locking Broken
**Problem**: Used to lock input during automation, now non-functional
**Evidence**: User reports "mouse and keyboard used to be locked while typing. this used to work"
**Impact**: Automation can be interrupted by user input

### Issue 4: Window Title Consistency
**Problem**: Tab shows "Claude Code CLI environment" but need to ensure window title matches
**Evidence**: User request for window title verification
**Previous Solution**: Our Set-ClaudeCodeWindow.ps1 found correct window with title "Claude Code CLI environment"

## Current Module Status
From console output:
- Unity-Claude-AutonomousAgent v2.0.0 initialized
- 95+ functions loaded across 12 modules
- FileSystemWatcher active and monitoring
- CLISubmission module loaded but using wrong window detection logic

## Implementation Plan Status
- **Phase 3**: System Status Monitoring (95% complete)
- **Current**: Phase 4 Advanced Features in progress
- **Achievement**: Day 18 System Status Monitoring fully implemented
- **Next**: Fix critical window detection and timing issues

## Key Files Involved
1. **CLISubmission Module** - Wrong window detection logic
2. **system_status.json** - Has correct TerminalWindowHandle but not being used
3. **Set-ClaudeCodeWindow.ps1** - Our working solution for correct window detection
4. **Monitoring Loop Code** - Timing calculation error
5. **SendKeys/BlockInput Code** - Mouse/keyboard locking functionality

## Previous Research Context
- **Completed**: 25 web searches on Windows PID detection (2025-08-20)
- **Discovery**: Node.js processes don't have window handles
- **Solution**: Created window handle detection scripts
- **Status**: Research complete, implementation needed in CLISubmission module

## Research Findings (4 Web Queries)

### Query 1: PowerShell Timer Interval Issues
**Problem**: Timer intervals in PowerShell don't work correctly due to multiple parallel timers
**Root Cause**: "Previous timer still exists; each time we run it we're adding another parallel thread"
**Solution**: Add $timer.Dispose() to properly clean up timer objects
**Impact**: Explains why monitoring messages come every 6-8 seconds instead of 30

### Query 2: BlockInput API Limitations
**Problem**: BlockInput requires elevated permissions and has restrictions
**Root Cause**: BlockInput "may only work if script run as administrator" and UAC can block it
**Solution**: Use SendMode Input/Play or direct window message posting instead
**Impact**: Mouse/keyboard locking broken due to permission/UAC issues

### Query 3: Get-Uptime Accuracy Problems  
**Problem**: Get-Uptime becomes "increasingly inaccurate" due to QPC timer drift
**Root Cause**: QueryPerformanceCounter drifts over time, not corrected by Windows time sync
**Solution**: Use (Get-Date) - (Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime
**Impact**: Explains wrong uptime calculation in monitoring messages

### Query 4: Windows Terminal Title Control
**Problem**: Shells can override tab titles at any time
**Root Cause**: PowerShell modules like posh-git override $host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle
**Solution**: Use suppressApplicationTitle setting in Windows Terminal profile
**Impact**: Need to ensure window title matches tab title "Claude Code CLI environment"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: TerminalWindowHandle Being Deleted
**Root Cause**: Update-ClaudeCodePID.ps1 only preserves specific fields:
- ✅ TerminalPID (line 101)
- ✅ WindowTitle (line 109) 
- ❌ TerminalWindowHandle (MISSING!)
- ❌ TerminalProcessId (MISSING!)

**Fix Required**: Add preservation of TerminalWindowHandle and TerminalProcessId fields

### Issue 2: CLISubmission Ignores Window Handle
**Root Cause**: CLISubmission module doesn't check TerminalWindowHandle from system_status.json
**Current Logic**: Defaults to "Administrator: Windows PowerShell" search (line 504)
**Fix Required**: Use TerminalWindowHandle if available in system_status.json

### Issue 3: Timer Not Disposed Properly
**Root Cause**: Multiple parallel timers due to missing timer disposal
**Impact**: Messages every 6-8 seconds despite 30-second timer setting  
**Fix Required**: Add proper timer cleanup in monitoring loop

### Issue 4: BlockInput Permissions Issue  
**Root Cause**: BlockInput requires admin rights, UAC blocking functionality
**Impact**: Mouse/keyboard locking not working during automation
**Fix Required**: Implement alternative input protection or ensure admin rights
