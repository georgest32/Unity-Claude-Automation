# Phase 6: Monitoring & Logging Implementation
**Date**: 2025-08-24
**Previous Context**: CI/CD pipeline complete with testing and deployment workflows
**Topics**: Centralized Logging, Performance Monitoring, Health Checks, Alerting
**Current Phase**: Phase 6, Day 3-4, Hours 5-8

## Summary Information
- **Problem**: Need comprehensive monitoring and logging for production deployment
- **Objectives**: Implement centralized logging, performance monitoring, health checks, and alerting
- **Implementation Status**: Starting monitoring infrastructure setup

## Home State Analysis

### Current Infrastructure
```
Services Running:
├── PowerShell Modules (5985/5986)
├── LangGraph API (8000)
├── AutoGen GroupChat (8001)
├── Documentation Server (8080)
└── File Monitor Service

Existing Monitoring:
├── Basic health checks in docker-compose
├── JSON file logging configured
└── GitHub Actions artifacts for test results
```

### Requirements
1. **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all services
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics and performance
3. **Health Check Endpoints**: Comprehensive health status
4. **Alerting System**: Proactive notification of issues

## Implementation Plan

### Hour 5: Centralized Logging
- Set up ELK stack or similar
- Configure log aggregation
- Implement structured logging
- Create log retention policies

### Hour 6: Performance Monitoring
- Implement metrics collection
- Set up Prometheus/Grafana
- Create custom dashboards
- Configure performance baselines

### Hour 7: Health Check Endpoints
- Enhance existing health checks
- Add detailed status information
- Implement dependency checks
- Create unified health dashboard

### Hour 8: Alerting System
- Configure alert rules
- Set up notification channels
- Implement escalation policies
- Create runbooks for alerts

## Research Findings

### 1. Centralized Logging (ELK vs OpenTelemetry)
**ELK Stack Architecture**:
- ElasticSearch for storing raw logs
- Logstash for collecting and transforming logs
- Kibana for visualization
- Filebeat recommended for Docker container log shipping
- Production: Run ELK + Filebeat as ONE stack in Docker Swarm

**OpenTelemetry (Modern Approach)**:
- Vendor-neutral standard for observability
- OpenTelemetry Collector as standalone agent/gateway
- Supports multiple backends (Prometheus, Jaeger, Elasticsearch)
- Better correlation between traces, metrics, and logs
- 2025 trend: Convergence towards OpenTelemetry

### 2. Performance Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
**Core Components**:
- Prometheus: Time-series metrics collection
- Grafana: Visualization and dashboards
- cAdvisor: Container performance metrics
- Node Exporter: System-level metrics
- Loki: Log aggregation (faster than traditional indexing)

**Best Practices**:
- 15-second scrape intervals standard
- Enable Docker metrics endpoint: {"metrics-addr": "127.0.0.1:9323", "experimental": true}
- Small deployment: 2-4 CPU cores, 4-8GB RAM
- Use remote storage for long-term metrics retention

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
**Three Types of Probes**:
- **Liveness**: Determines when to restart (catches deadlocks)
- **Readiness**: Determines when ready for traffic
- **Startup**: For slow-starting containers

**2025 Best Practices**:
- Dedicated endpoints: /health/live, /health/ready
- Keep probes lightweight and fast
- Use startup probes for slow applications
- Avoid cascading failures with proper timing
- Docker healthcheck not integrated with Kubernetes

### 4. Alerting Systems
**Integration Components**:
- Prometheus Alertmanager for routing
- PagerDuty for incident management
- Slack for team notifications
- Webhooks for custom integrations

**Configuration**:
- Multi-channel redundancy essential
- Route by severity levels (L1 to PagerDuty, others to Slack)
- AI-powered platforms reducing alert fatigue
- Real-time collaboration through Slack integration

### 5. Windows Container Logging
**Special Considerations**:
- Windows containers lack native STDOUT pipeline
- LogMonitor tool creates STDOUT pipeline
- Fluent Bit has native Windows Event Log support
- PowerShell channels can be monitored
- Security channel requires admin privileges

### 6. Docker Compose Monitoring Stack
**Modern Architecture**:
- LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Metrics)
- Grafana Alloy as unified telemetry pipeline
- Service discovery via Docker socket mounting
- Inter-container communication via service names

### 7. Security Best Practices
**TLS/HTTPS**:
- Default TLS 1.2 minimum version
- Terminate TLS at proxy/load-balancer
- Use mTLS between services

**Authentication**:
- SSO integration (OIDC, SAML, LDAP)
- MFA enforcement
- RBAC with Admin, Editor, Viewer roles
- Audit logging for all operations

## Granular Implementation Steps

### Week 6, Day 3-4, Hours 5-8: Monitoring & Logging

#### Hour 5: Centralized Logging System
1. Create docker-compose.monitoring.yml with Loki stack
2. Configure Fluent Bit for log collection
3. Set up log parsing and enrichment
4. Configure retention policies (7 days default)
5. Integrate PowerShell module logs
6. Test log aggregation from all services

#### Hour 6: Performance Monitoring
1. Add Prometheus and Grafana services
2. Configure cAdvisor for container metrics
3. Set up Node Exporter for system metrics
4. Create custom dashboards for each service
5. Configure metric retention (30 days)
6. Set up metric scraping for all endpoints

#### Hour 7: Enhanced Health Checks
1. Create comprehensive health check endpoints
2. Implement /health/live for liveness
3. Implement /health/ready for readiness
4. Add dependency checks to readiness probe
5. Create unified health dashboard
6. Test health check monitoring

#### Hour 8: Alerting System
1. Configure Prometheus Alertmanager

- Grafana Alloy replaces multiple agents for unified collection
- Windows containers require LogMonitor for STDOUT pipeline
- Health checks must be lightweight to avoid cascade failures
- Multi-channel redundancy essential for alerting

## Implementation Progress
