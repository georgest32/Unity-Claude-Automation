# Test-CLIOrchestrator-Serialization Analysis
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Time:** 12:45 PM  
**Problem:** Test script syntax error - missing string terminator
**Previous Context:** CLIOrchestrator path corruption fix implementation
**Topics:** PowerShell syntax, string termination, test script debugging

## Test Results Summary
- **Test Script:** Test-CLIOrchestrator-Serialization.ps1
- **Exit Code:** 1 (Failed)
- **Duration:** 5.06 seconds
- **Error Type:** ParserError - TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString
- **Location:** Line 199, character 64

## Error Analysis
The test script failed to run due to a syntax error:
1. **Primary Error:** Missing string terminator at line 199
2. **Cascading Errors:** Missing closing braces due to initial parsing failure
3. **Root Cause:** String quotation not properly closed

## Home State
- **Project:** Unity-Claude-Automation
- **Working Directory:** C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation
- **Module Under Test:** Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator-Original.psm1
- **Test Purpose:** Validate serialization fix for path corruption issue

## Objectives
- **Short Term:** Fix syntax error in test script
- **Long Term:** Ensure serialization fix properly handles all object types

## Current Implementation Status
- Implemented Convert-ToSerializedString helper function
- Modified New-AutonomousPrompt to serialize ActionDetails
- Test script created but has syntax error preventing execution

## Root Cause Identified
The test script contained non-ASCII Unicode characters (✓ and ✗) which violated directive #15 "USE ASCII CHARACTERS ONLY". These Unicode checkmark and cross characters were causing PowerShell parser errors that manifested as string terminator errors.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced all Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents:
- ✓ replaced with [PASS]
- ✗ replaced with [FAIL] 
- Error case uses [ERROR]

This ensures compliance with ASCII-only requirements and prevents PowerShell parsing issues.

## Files Modified
- Test-CLIOrchestrator-Serialization.ps1: Replaced 6 instances of Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents
- Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator-Original.psm1: Fixed Convert-ToSerializedString to handle PSCustomObjects separately from hashtables

## Test Results After Fixes
### First Fix (Unicode removal):
- Parser errors resolved
- Test script now executes

### Second Fix (PSCustomObject handling):
- 4/5 tests passing initially
- Error: PSCustomObject doesn't have ContainsKey method
- Solution: Separate PSCustomObject logic using PSObject.Properties instead of ContainsKey
