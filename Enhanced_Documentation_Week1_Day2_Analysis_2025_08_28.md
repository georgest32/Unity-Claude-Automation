# Enhanced Documentation System - Week 1, Day 2 Analysis
## Call Graph Builder & Data Flow Tracker Implementation

### Summary Information
- **Problem**: Need to implement call graph and data flow analysis for CPG
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Time**: 02:15 AM
- **Previous Context**: Day 1 completed - thread safety and advanced edges implemented
- **Topics**: Call graph construction, function invocation tracking, data flow analysis, taint analysis

### Home State Review
**Project**: Unity-Claude-Automation
**Location**: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation
**Current Module**: Unity-Claude-CPG (Code Property Graph)

### Completed Components (Day 1)
1. **CPG-ThreadSafeOperations.psm1** - Thread-safe graph operations with ReaderWriterLockSlim
2. **CPG-AdvancedEdges.psm1** - 27 specialized edge types across 5 categories
3. **CPG-Unified.psm1** - Unified module with proper class inheritance
4. **Debug Logging System** - Comprehensive tracing throughout all modules

### Current Objectives (Day 2)
**Morning Session**: Call Graph Builder

### Implementation Plan

#### Morning: Call Graph Builder (4 hours)
1. **Hour 1-2**: Core call graph structure
   - Design call node representation
   - Implement invocation edge types
   - Create call stack tracking

2. **Hour 3-4**: Advanced features
   - Recursive call detection
   - Virtual method resolution
   - Indirect call handling
   - Call frequency analysis

#### Afternoon: Data Flow Tracker (4 hours)
1. **Hour 1-2**: Basic data flow
   - Variable lifecycle tracking
   - Assignment tracking
   - Use-def chains

2. **Hour 3-4**: Advanced analysis
   - Taint analysis
   - Reaching definitions
   - Live variable analysis
   - Data sensitivity tracking

### Research Findings

#### Call Graph Construction
1. **Major Algorithms**:
   - Class Hierarchy Analysis (CHA) - considers type hierarchy for dynamic dispatch
   - Rapid Type Analysis (RTA) - builds upon CHA with runtime type information
   - Points-to Analysis - optimized analysis for control flow reconstruction
   - Field-based Construction - for JavaScript/dynamic languages

2. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - Dynamic dispatch requires alias analysis
   - First-class functions complicate tracking
   - Precision vs performance trade-offs
   - Language-specific complexities

3. **Key Features Needed**:
   - Function invocation edge tracking
   - Virtual/override method resolution
   - Indirect call handling (function pointers, delegates)
   - Recursive call detection with cycle handling

#### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Core Concepts**:
   - **Def-Use Chains**: Track definition to usage paths
   - **Use-Def Chains**: Track usage back to definitions
   - **Reaching Definitions**: Which definitions reach a point
   - **Live Variable Analysis**: Variables live at each program point

2. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Forward flow analysis for reaching definitions
   - Backward flow analysis for live variables
   - Worklist algorithm for iterative computation
   - Set union as confluence operator

3. **Taint Analysis**:
   - Track untrusted data through program
   - Identify injection vulnerabilities
   - Model string manipulation operations
   - Security-focused data flow tracking

#### PowerShell AST Integration
1. **AST Access Methods**:
   - ParseFile for script files
   - ParseInput for code strings
   - ScriptBlock.Ast for loaded functions

2. **Key AST Types**:
   - CommandAst - function/cmdlet invocations
   - VariableExpressionAst - variable usage
   - ParameterAst - function parameters
   - AssignmentStatementAst - variable assignments

3. **FindAll Method**:
   - Recursive search through AST
   - Predicate-based filtering
   - Nested script block support

### Known Considerations
- Must integrate with existing CPG-Unified.psm1
- Should leverage thread-safe operations from Day 1
- Need to maintain debug logging consistency
- Must support PowerShell, C#, Python, JavaScript analysis

### Success Metrics
- Call graph accurately tracks all function invocations
- Data flow captures variable lifecycles
- Both integrate seamlessly with existing CPG
- Performance target: <100ms per file analysis
- Support for cross-function data flow

### Blockers/Risks
- Complex indirect calls may be difficult to track
- Dynamic typing in PowerShell/Python complicates analysis
- Performance concerns with deep call stacks
- Memory usage with large codebases
