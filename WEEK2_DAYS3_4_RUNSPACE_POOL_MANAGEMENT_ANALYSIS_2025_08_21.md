4. Create resource limit enforcement and protection mechanisms
5. Implement comprehensive testing for resource control

## üî¨ Research Findings (First 5 Web Queries COMPLETED)

### PowerShell Runspace Pool Lifecycle Management

#### Pool Creation and Configuration Patterns
- **CreateRunspacePool Method**: `[runspacefactory]::CreateRunspacePool(1, $MaxRunspaces, $InitialSessionState, $Host)`
- **Thread Limits**: Minimum and maximum runspace limits for throttling
- **Recommended Size**: Default pool size of 5, can be increased based on CPU cores
- **ApartmentState**: Set to MTA for better performance in most scenarios

#### BeginInvoke/EndInvoke Job Management
**Core Pattern**:
```powershell
# 1. Create pool and open
$RunspacePool = [runspacefactory]::CreateRunspacePool(1, 5)
$RunspacePool.Open()

# 2. Submit jobs
$Jobs = @()
foreach ($Item in $ItemList) {
    $PowerShell = [powershell]::Create()
    $PowerShell.RunspacePool = $RunspacePool
    $PowerShell.AddScript($ScriptBlock).AddParameter('Parameter', $Item)
    $Jobs += @{
        PowerShell = $PowerShell
        AsyncResult = $PowerShell.BeginInvoke()
    }
}

# 3. Monitor completion
while ($Jobs.AsyncResult.IsCompleted -contains $false) {
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 100
}

# 4. Retrieve results and cleanup
$Results = $Jobs | ForEach-Object {
    $_.PowerShell.EndInvoke($_.AsyncResult)
    $_.PowerShell.Dispose()
}
$RunspacePool.Close()
$RunspacePool.Dispose()
```

#### Advanced Monitoring Capabilities
- **Pool Status**: `$RunspacePool.GetAvailableRunspaces()` for current availability
- **Job State Tracking**: `$AsyncResult.IsCompleted` property for individual job status
- **Advanced State**: Reflection techniques available for deeper pipeline state analysis

### Throttling and Resource Control Research

#### Throttling Mechanisms
- **Queue Management**: Automatic queuing when max runspaces reached
- **Dynamic Scaling**: New jobs start when others complete
- **Thread Pool Sizing**: Critical for performance vs resource balance
- **ThrottleLimit**: Primary mechanism for controlling concurrent execution

#### Resource Control Challenges
- **CPU Limits**: No direct CPU percentage limits available for runspace pools
- **Memory Monitoring**: Requires external monitoring, no built-in hard limits
- **Module Import Contention**: Performance bottleneck when multiple runspaces import same modules
- **Resource Cleanup**: Critical for preventing memory leaks

#### Performance Optimization Patterns
- **Pool Size**: Too many runspaces = diminishing returns, too few = underutilized
- **Module Pre-loading**: Import modules before pool creation to reduce contention
- **Thread-Safe Collections**: ConcurrentDictionary for output collection
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always dispose PowerShell instances and close pools

### Advanced Resource Control and Monitoring (Queries 6-10)

#### Performance Counter Integration
- **Get-Counter**: `Get-Counter -Counter "Processor(_Total)% Processor Time"` for CPU monitoring
- **Memory Monitoring**: `"Memory\Available MBytes"` counter for memory tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance counter data for runspace pool resource tracking
- **Windows Server 2025**: Enhanced PowerShell 7 integration for performance tuning

#### Job Queue Management and Priority Scheduling
- **Queue Throttling**: Automatic queuing when max runspaces reached
- **Priority Patterns**: Multiple queue approach for priority-based job scheduling
- **BeginInvoke Scheduling**: BeginInvoke schedules work orders in queue for when runspace available
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: Increase priority of aged messages to prevent starvation

#### Resource Cleanup and Memory Leak Prevention
**Critical Issues Identified**:
- **Memory Leaks**: Runspace pools have known memory leaks in PowerShell v5/v6 (not v2)
- **Disposal Order**: Must dispose in correct sequence: EndInvoke ‚Üí Runspace.Dispose ‚Üí PowerShell.Dispose
- **SessionStateCmdLetEntry Leaks**: Can consume 1GB+ memory per day without proper cleanup
- **Import-PSSession**: Known memory leak issues with remote session imports

**Research-Validated Cleanup Pattern**:
```powershell
# Proper disposal sequence
$_.PowerShell.EndInvoke($_.AsyncResult)
$_.PowerShell.Runspace.Dispose()  # Dispose runspace first
$_.PowerShell.Dispose()           # Then dispose PowerShell instance
```

#### Error Handling and Cancellation
- **EndInvoke Errors**: "The pipeline has been stopped" - check thread state before EndInvoke
- **Exception Detection**: Use `$Error[0].Exception.InnerException` for actual error location
- **Cancellation Tokens**: PowerShell 7+ supports `$PSCmdlet.PipelineStopToken` for modern cancellation
- **Timeout Management**: `New-TimeSpan -Seconds $Timeout` with runtime monitoring patterns

#### 2025 Performance Optimization
- **Module Import Contention**: Major bottleneck - import modules one at a time before pool creation
- **Thread Pool Sizing**: Balance between too many (diminishing returns) and too few (underutilized)
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU/Memory monitoring during runspace operations for bottleneck detection
- **Garbage Collection**: Manual `[System.GC]::Collect()` for long-running processes
