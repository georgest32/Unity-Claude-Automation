    - **HERE-STRING VARIABLE EXPANSION FIX (Round 5)**: Fixed fundamental variable stripping issue (Learning #240)
      - **Root Cause Identified**: Double-quoted here-strings (@"..."@) expand variables to empty strings
      - **Evidence**: Debug output showed $Instance, $Type, $this, etc. becoming empty in test content
      - **Syntax Corruption**: Variable expansion caused parse errors like "Missing expression after -not"
      - **Solution Applied**: Converted all here-strings from @"..."@ to @'...'@ for literal preservation
      - **Scope**: Fixed 4 test content here-strings + 1 PS51Compatible module here-string

## 📝 Usage Workflows

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to Unity project
2. Run `Unity-Claude-Automation.ps1 -RunOnce`
3. System detects compilation errors
4. Automatically submits to Claude
5. Applies fixes and retests
6. Reports success/failure

### Continuous Monitoring
```powershell
# Start monitoring
.\Unity-Claude-Automation.ps1 -Loop -EnableDatabase -GenerateReport

# System will:
# 1. Watch for Unity compilation
# 2. Detect errors automatically
# 3. Submit to Claude for analysis
# 4. Apply fixes
# 5. Learn from outcomes
# 6. Generate reports
```

### Manual Intervention
```powershell
# Export errors manually
.\Export-Tools\Export-ErrorsForClaude-Fixed.ps1

# Submit with specific model
.\API-Integration\Submit-ErrorsToClaude-API.ps1 -Model 'claude-3-opus'

# Generate report
.\Unity-Claude-Automation.ps1 -GenerateReport
```

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Claude CLI changes | High | Dual API/CLI support |
| Unity version incompatibility | Medium | Version detection & adaptation |
| Database corruption | Low | Regular backups, transaction logs |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Profiling, optimization passes |

### Operational Risks
- **API rate limits**: Implement throttling and queuing
- **Cost overruns**: Token usage monitoring and limits
- **False positives**: Manual review option, confidence scoring
- **Breaking changes**: Version pinning, compatibility checks
