# Blockers and Issues

## Current Blockers
1. **Test Infrastructure**: Need to create comprehensive test framework from scratch
2. **Performance Baselines**: No current performance baselines established
3. **Stress Testing Environment**: Need controlled environment for stress testing
4. **Mock Framework**: PowerShell 5.1 compatible mocking needs implementation

## Resolution Plan
1. **Test Framework**: Implement modular test framework with PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
2. **Performance Measurement**: Create baseline measurement tools and establish targets
3. **Environment Setup**: Use isolated test environment with controlled resources
4. **Mock Implementation**: Create simple, effective mocking for PowerShell 5.1

# Critical Learnings to Keep in Mind

## PowerShell 5.1 Compatibility
- UTF-8 BOM requirement for script files
- No backtick escape sequences in strings
- Limited async capabilities compared to PS7
- Mutex re-entrancy is by design in Windows

## Bootstrap Orchestrator Patterns
- Mutex-based singleton enforcement prevents duplicates
- Manifest-driven configuration enables generic subsystem support
- Topological sorting enables dependency-driven startup
- Circuit breaker patterns provide failure protection

## Testing Best Practices
- PowerShell 5.1 requires specific compatibility patterns
- Mock frameworks must be simple and reliable
- Performance testing requires controlled environments
- Stress testing must include cleanup and recovery validation
