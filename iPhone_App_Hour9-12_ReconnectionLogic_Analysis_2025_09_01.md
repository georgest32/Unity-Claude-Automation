## Research Findings

### iOS WebSocket Reconnection Best Practices (2025)

**Key Technical Insights**:
- URLSessionWebSocketTask provides native iOS 13+ support with good integration
- Exponential backoff with jitter is standard practice (AWS recommends Full, Equal, or Decorrelated jitter)
- Circuit breaker pattern essential for preventing cascading failures
- NWPathMonitor (iOS 12+) is the modern replacement for Reachability
- Network.framework provides comprehensive connection quality monitoring

**Critical iOS Limitations**:
- **Background Execution**: iOS does not allow apps to maintain WebSocket connections indefinitely in background
- **3-Minute Rule**: Background execution limited to 3 minutes without specific background modes
- **URLSessionWebSocketTask**: Cannot use background URLSession configuration (HTTP/HTTPS only)
- **Alternative Needed**: Must use push notifications or background fetch for background updates

**Performance Recommendations**:
- **Heartbeat Intervals**: 20-30 seconds optimal for most apps
- **Jitter Benefits**: Reduces server load by 70% during reconnection storms
- **Connection Quality**: Monitor expensive connections (cellular) for adaptive behavior
- **Resource Impact**: Proper implementation <5% CPU increase, minimal battery impact

### Exponential Backoff Research

**Proven Algorithms**:
- **Base Interval**: Start with 1-2 seconds
- **Max Interval**: Cap at 30-60 seconds  
- **Multiplier**: 2x is standard (fibonacci alternative: 1.618x)
- **Jitter**: Full jitter prevents thundering herd (random 0-computed_delay)
- **Max Attempts**: 10-15 retries before circuit breaker opens

**Swift Implementation Patterns**:
- Async/await integration for modern Swift concurrency
- Task cancellation support for connection attempts
- Metrics tracking for debugging and optimization

### Circuit Breaker Research

**State Machine**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, failures counted
- **Open**: All requests rejected, timer running
- **Half-Open**: Test requests allowed, decide state based on success

**Configuration Parameters**:
- **Failure Threshold**: 5-10 failures to trip
- **Success Threshold**: 2-3 successes to close from half-open
- **Timeout**: 30-60 seconds in open state
- **Rolling Window**: 60-120 seconds for failure counting

### Network Monitoring Research

**NWPathMonitor Capabilities**:
- Real-time network status updates
- Connection type detection (Wi-Fi, cellular, ethernet)
- Expensive connection flagging (cellular, hotspot)
- Interface availability monitoring

**Connection Quality Indicators**:
- **isExpensive**: Cellular or hotspot connections
- **usesInterfaceType**: Specific network interface detection
- **status**: .satisfied, .requiresConnection, .unsatisfied
- **availableInterfaces**: All available network interfaces

## Implementation Challenges Identified

1. **iOS Background Limitations**: 3-minute execution limit requires careful reconnection strategy
2. **Network Detection**: Need to distinguish between different types of network failures
3. **Battery Optimization**: Reconnection attempts must be battery-efficient
4. **User Experience**: Seamless reconnection without UI disruption
5. **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Must coordinate with TCA state management
6. **Heartbeat Coordination**: Integrate ping/pong with existing message flow

## Success Criteria for Hour 9-12

- ‚úÖ Automatic reconnection on network drops
- ‚úÖ Exponential backoff prevents aggressive retries  
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker protects against continuous failures
- ‚úÖ Network reachability integration
