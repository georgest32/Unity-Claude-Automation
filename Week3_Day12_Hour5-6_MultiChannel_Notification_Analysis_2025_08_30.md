3. Test integration with existing intelligent alerting system
4. Validate multi-channel delivery and preferences
5. Update implementation documentation and create completion response

## Research Findings Summary (8 Comprehensive Web Searches - 2025 Technology Validation)

### 1. Multi-Channel Integration Architecture Trends
**Key Finding**: Modern enterprise systems are moving away from email-centric approaches toward chat-based notification systems as alternatives, with PowerShell serving as a versatile automation layer for connecting multiple communication channels.

**Critical Insights**:
- 80% of organizations will use cloud-native platforms for application integration by 2025
- Real-time dashboard integration using WebSocket patterns for immediate client updates
- JSON-based configuration systems with validation and schema support

### 2. Slack Integration Implementation (2025 Standards)
**Authentication**: Slack webhooks don't require token-based authentication but broader API access uses bearer tokens
**Security**: Never write tokens to disk in plaintext, use PowerShell credential management
**PSSlack Module**: Proven PowerShell module for simplified Slack integration
**Rate Limiting**: IP address restrictions available but don't apply to incoming webhooks

### 3. Microsoft Teams Integration (Critical 2025 Changes)
**URGENT**: Office 365 connectors will be retired end of 2025
**Migration Required**: Webhook URLs must be updated by January 31, 2025
**New Standard**: Power Automate Workflows recommended over deprecated connectors
**Authentication**: Moving toward Azure AD/Microsoft Entra ID integration
**Rate Limiting**: 4 requests per second maximum, throttling after that

### 4. Email Integration Best Practices (2025)
**Deprecated**: Send-MailMessage obsolete due to security concerns
**Recommended**: MailKit library (cross-platform, secure, Microsoft employee maintained)
**Security**: OAuth2 required for Microsoft 365 (SMTP AUTH discontinued 2025)
**Implementation**: PowerShell 7+ preferred for improved security features

### 5. Enterprise Notification Routing Patterns
**Modern Approach**: Tag-driven logic replaces manual configuration
**Rule Priority**: Sequential processing from lowest to highest priority numbers
**Configuration**: JSON-based rule configuration with inhibition, routing, and receivers
**Scalability**: Designed to handle hundreds of notifications per second

### 6. Real-Time Dashboard Integration
**Technology**: PowerShell Universal Dashboard with WebSocket support
**Pattern**: Client-server architecture with JSON data exchange
**Features**: AutoReload functionality using WebSockets for server-initiated updates
**Integration**: TheDashboard module for multi-report integration

### 7. Escalation Patterns (2025 AI-Enhanced)
**Agentic AI**: ReAct pattern for real-time diagnosis with human escalation
**Traditional**: Channel escalation with time-based progression
**Enterprise**: Automated persistent notifications across voice, text, push, email, IM
**Tracking**: Delivery confirmation, acknowledgments, and automatic escalation chains

### 8. Configuration Management Security
**JSON Handling**: ConvertFrom-Json with -Raw parameter for PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
**Secret Management**: Configuration-as-code with secure credential storage
**Validation**: Schema validation and environmental configuration layers
**Version Control**: Configuration files tracked alongside scripts

## Revised Implementation Architecture (Research-Validated)

### Priority 1: Core Integration Module
**Unity-Claude-NotificationIntegration.psm1**
- Multi-channel routing with priority-based delivery
- JSON configuration with validation schema
- MailKit integration for secure email (PowerShell 5.1 compatible)
- Webhook authentication with token management

### Priority 2: External System Integrations
**Slack Integration**: PSSlack module wrapper with enterprise security
**Teams Integration**: Power Automate Workflow pattern (2025 compliant)
**Dashboard Integration**: PowerShell Universal Dashboard WebSocket pattern

### Priority 3: Configuration and Preferences
**JSON Schema**: Layered configuration with environment overrides
**Rule Engine**: Tag-driven routing with sequential priority processing
**Security**: Azure KeyVault integration for token management
**Escalation**: Time-based escalation with AI-enhanced decision making

### Priority 4: Testing and Validation
**Multi-Channel Tests**: Validate all delivery channels with synthetic alerts
**Performance Tests**: Confirm < 30 second response time targets
**Security Tests**: Token validation and authentication verification
**Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow with existing intelligent alerting
