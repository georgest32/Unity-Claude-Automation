## üî¨ RESEARCH FINDINGS (10 Web Queries Completed)

### Integration Patterns Research (Queries 1-2)
**Observer Pattern for Notification Systems**: 
- Observer pattern addresses one-to-many dependency between objects without tight coupling
- Event-driven architecture is extremely loosely coupled and well distributed
- PowerShell Workflow uses Windows Workflow Foundation with benefits including simultaneous multi-device actions and automatic failure recovery
- Webhook implementation with PowerShell enables event-based (not request-based) communication

**Key Implementation**: Centralized broker pattern manages subscriptions, routing between publishers/subscribers with message passing systems

### Reliability and Testing Research (Queries 3-4)
**Load Testing and Reliability**: 
- 20% of webhook events fail in production according to Hookdeck research
- Load testing essential for applications processing many webhooks
- Multiple testing layers: unit tests, functional tests, load tests, performance profiling

**Fallback Mechanisms**:
- Circuit breaker pattern (Closed/Open/Half-Open states) with retry logic
- Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd problems
- Fallback patterns provide alternative responses for continuity
- Combined retry + circuit breaker patterns before threshold reached

### Configuration Management Research (Query 5)
**Centralized Configuration**:
- Spring Cloud Config pattern: externalized configuration in distributed systems with broadcast events
- AWS Systems Manager: JSON files in S3 with SSM Agent for configuration deployment
- Environment-specific configurations with CONFIG_FOLDER and APP_ENV variables
- Centralized changes apply once regardless of service count with runtime refresh

### PowerShell-Specific Patterns (Queries 6-10)
**PowerShell Module Configuration**:
- powershell.config.json for startup configuration with runtime modification
- JSON pattern: Get-Content | ConvertFrom-Json with error handling
- Alternative PSD1 format designed for PowerShell with Import-PowerShellDataFile
- Security considerations: sanitized scripts with external configuration files

**Asynchronous and Queue Management**:
- RunspacePool for throttled concurrent execution (50 items, 6 concurrent)
- BeginInvoke() for async pipeline execution with AsyncResult monitoring
- Azure Service Bus dead letter queues with PowerShell management
- MSMQ dead letter queues with Set-MsmqQueueManagerACL permissions

**Testing and Documentation**:
- Pester framework for unit testing with Mock capabilities
- Integration testing approaches: mock external calls vs real system testing
- Notification system best practices: right message, user, frequency, channel, timing
- Troubleshooting guides emphasize step-by-step instructions and FAQ documentation

### Integration Strategy with Existing Systems
- **Non-Invasive**: Add notification calls without modifying core logic
- **Configurable**: Enable/disable notifications via configuration
- **Performant**: Asynchronous notification delivery to avoid blocking
- **Resilient**: Failures in notifications don't affect main workflow
- **Testable**: Mock notification system for testing
