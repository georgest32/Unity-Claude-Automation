## Research Findings

### 1. iOS Biometric Authentication (LocalAuthentication Framework)
**Research Completed**: Modern iOS biometric implementation with Face ID/Touch ID

**Key Findings**:
- **LocalAuthentication Framework**: Standard for biometric auth, requires iOS 13+
- **Info.plist Requirement**: NSFaceIDUsageDescription key mandatory for Face ID
- **Authentication Policies**: Use .deviceOwnerAuthentication for biometrics + passcode fallback
- **Modern Patterns**: Async/await integration with SwiftUI ObservableObject patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive LAError cases including lockout, cancellation, system errors
- **Thread Safety**: Main thread dispatch required for UI updates post-authentication

**Implementation Pattern**:
```swift
let context = LAContext()
let success = try await context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthentication, localizedReason: reason)
```

### 2. iOS Keychain Services for Secure Storage
**Research Completed**: JWT token and credential storage best practices

**Key Findings**:
- **Keychain vs UserDefaults**: Keychain provides encryption, UserDefaults stores plain text
- **JWT Token Storage**: Industry standard for secure authentication token storage
- **Query Dictionary Pattern**: kSec attributes for secure storage configuration
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Keychain handles encryption and secure cleanup
- **Unique Account Requirements**: Each stored item needs unique kSecAttrAccount identifier
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Initialize app state based on stored tokens for persistent login

**Security Attributes**:
```swift
kSecAttrAccessible as String: kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked // Secure access control
```

### 3. iOS Certificate Pinning for API Security
**Research Completed**: SSL/TLS security for API communications

**Key Findings**:
