# iOS Build Fixes Applied
**Date**: 2025-09-03
**Target**: iOS AgentDashboard App
**Build Environment**: Xcode CI/CD (arm64 simulator)

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Swift 6 Sendable Conformance
- Added `Sendable` conformance to all `@Reducer` structs:
  - `AgentsFeature`
  - `AppFeature` 
  - `DashboardFeature`
  - `TerminalFeature`
  - `ModeManagementFeature`

### 2. TCA DependencyKey Fixes
- **APIClient**: Changed `testValue` from static constant to computed property
- Made `testValue` public as required by Swift 6

### 3. State Sendable Conformance
- Added `Sendable` to all State structs in features
- Ensured State structs are public where needed

### 4. ModeManagementFeature Visibility
- Made `Action` enum public
- Added public `init()` method
- Made `body` property public

### 5. Missing Models Created
- Created `SystemStatus.swift` with full model implementation
- Created `Module` struct with status tracking
- Both models include Sendable conformance

### 6. View Perception Tracking
- Updated `ModeAwareDashboard` to use `WithPerceptionTracking`
- Changed from `@Bindable` to proper store.state access pattern
- Fixed all store property accesses to use `store.state`

### 7. Store Scoping Fixes
- Fixed `AppContentView` to properly pass scoped stores to `ModeAwareDashboard`
- Added proper store scoping for dashboard and mode management

## Files Modified
1. `APIClient.swift` - DependencyKey testValue fix
2. `AgentsFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
3. `AppFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
4. `DashboardFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
5. `TerminalFeature.swift` - Sendable conformance
6. `ModeManagementFeature.swift` - Visibility and Sendable fixes
7. `ModeAwareDashboard.swift` - WithPerceptionTracking and store.state fixes
8. `AgentDashboardApp.swift` - Store scoping fixes

## Files Created
1. `SystemStatus.swift` - Complete model implementation

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Run local build to verify compilation
2. Check for any remaining Swift 6 warnings
3. Test on CI/CD environment
4. Verify all features work with perception tracking

## Known Remaining Issues
- May need to verify all dependency clients have proper testValue implementations
- Should check if other views need WithPerceptionTracking wrapper
- May need to add more public visibility modifiers if compilation still fails

## Build Command
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme AgentDashboard -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build
```
