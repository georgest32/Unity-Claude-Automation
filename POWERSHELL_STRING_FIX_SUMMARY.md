# PowerShell String Terminator Fix Summary
Date: 2025-08-16

## Root Cause
The PowerShell scripts were experiencing parsing errors due to:
1. Complex string interpolations inside Write-Host statements: `$($_.Error)`
2. Special Unicode characters (checkmarks, emojis) that got corrupted
3. Nested quotes and variable expansion issues

## Solution Applied

### Key Fix Pattern
Instead of complex interpolations like:
```powershell
Write-Host "Error: $($_.Error)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

Use variable assignment first:
```powershell
$errorMsg = $_.Error
Write-Host "Error: $errorMsg" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

### Character Replacements
- Replaced Unicode checkmarks (✓, ✗) with text (PASSED, FAILED)
- Removed smart quotes that may have been introduced
- Fixed encoding issues by recreating files with UTF-8 encoding

## Files Fixed
1. **Test-BidirectionalCommunication.ps1** - Replaced with clean version
2. **Unity-Claude-IPC-Bidirectional.psm1** - Fixed queue assignment pattern
3. Created **Fix-PowerShellStringIssues.ps1** - Automated fix script for future use

## Files Still Needing Manual Review
Several files still have parsing errors that need manual fixes:
- Submit-ErrorsToClaude-API-Fixed.ps1
- Submit-ErrorsToClaude.ps1
- BidirectionalClient-Example.ps1
- Export-ErrorsForClaude.ps1
- Watch-AndReport.ps1
- Run-ModuleTests.ps1
- Test-UnityClaudeModules.ps1
- Unity-Claude-Automation.ps1

These files have `.fix-needed.txt` files with details about remaining errors.

## Prevention
To prevent this in the future:
1. Avoid complex string interpolations in Write-Host
2. Use ASCII characters instead of Unicode symbols
3. Always save files with UTF-8 encoding
4. Test scripts with `[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile()` before committing
