# Safe Automated Command Execution Design
*Date: 2025-08-18 15:45*
*Context: Secure automation framework for executing Claude's TEST/BUILD/ANALYZE recommendations*
*Previous Topics: Command injection prevention, PowerShell runspace security, Unity automation*

## Summary Information

**Problem**: Design secure automated command execution system for Claude's "RECOMMENDED: TYPE - details" responses
**Date/Time**: 2025-08-18 15:45
**Previous Context**: Initial security concerns about command injection were overly conservative for controlled development environments
**Topics Involved**: PowerShell runspace isolation, command whitelisting, validation frameworks, Unity development automation

## Safe Automation Framework Design

### Core Security Principles

1. **Constrained Runspace Execution** - Isolated PowerShell runspaces with whitelisted commands only
2. **Command Type Validation** - Only allow predefined command types (TEST, BUILD, ANALYZE)
3. **Parameter Sanitization** - Strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters
4. **Execution Context Control** - Run commands in controlled environment with timeouts
5. **Comprehensive Logging** - Full audit trail of all automated command execution

### Whitelisted Command Categories

**TEST Commands**:
- Unity test execution (Unity.exe -runTests)
- PowerShell module tests (Invoke-Pester)
- Validation scripts (Test-*.ps1)
- Compilation verification (Test-UnityCompilation)

**BUILD Commands**:
- Unity build generation (Unity.exe -buildTarget)
- Asset import/refresh (Unity.exe -importPackage)
- Script compilation (Unity.exe -executeMethod)
- Project validation (Unity.exe -projectPath)

**ANALYZE Commands**:
- Log analysis (Get-Content, Select-String)
- Error pattern analysis (existing learning functions)
- Performance analysis (Measure-Command)
- Report generation (Export-*, Get-*)

### Implementation Architecture

```powershell
# Safe Command Execution Framework
class SafeCommandExecutor {
    [hashtable]$WhitelistedCommands
    [hashtable]$ParameterValidators
    [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Runspace]$ConstrainedRunspace
    [int]$DefaultTimeoutMs = 300000  # 5 minutes
    [string]$LogPath
}

# Command validation and execution
function Invoke-SafeAutomatedCommand {
    param(
        [ValidateSet("TEST", "BUILD", "ANALYZE")]
        [string]$CommandType,
        
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string]$CommandDetails,
        
        [int]$TimeoutMs = 300000,
        [switch]$DryRun
    )
}
```

### Security Validations

**1. Command Type Validation**
- Only allow TEST, BUILD, ANALYZE command types
- Reject any command type not in whitelist
- Log all validation attempts and results

**2. Parameter Sanitization**
- Remove special characters that could enable injection
- Validate file paths exist and are within project boundaries
- Escape all parameters before execution
- Use parameterized command construction

**3. Runspace Isolation**
- Create constrained runspace with limited cmdlets
- No access to Invoke-Expression, Add-Type with code
- No file system access outside project directory
- No network access capabilities

**4. Execution Context Control**
- Mandatory timeouts for all commands
- Resource limits (memory, CPU)
- Working directory restrictions
- Environment variable controls

### Safe Implementation Examples

**TEST Command Execution**:
```powershell
# Safe: Whitelisted Unity test command
$safeCommand = "Unity.exe"
$safeArgs = @("-runTests", "-projectPath", $ValidatedProjectPath, "-testResults", $ValidatedOutputPath)
& $safeCommand @safeArgs
```

**BUILD Command Execution**:
```powershell
# Safe: Parameterized Unity build
$safeCommand = "Unity.exe" 
$safeArgs = @("-buildTarget", $ValidatedTarget, "-projectPath", $ValidatedProjectPath)
& $safeCommand @safeArgs
```

### Risk Mitigation

**What Makes This Safe**:
1. **No Dynamic Code Generation** - No Invoke-Expression or Add-Type usage
2. **Predefined Command Set** - Only known safe Unity/PowerShell commands
3. **Parameter Validation** - All inputs validated and sanitized
4. **Isolated Execution** - Constrained runspace with limited capabilities
5. **Comprehensive Logging** - Full audit trail of all executions
6. **Timeout Protection** - All commands have mandatory timeouts
7. **Human Override** - Manual approval option for edge cases

**Command Injection Prevention**:
- All commands constructed using parameter arrays, not string concatenation
- No user input directly concatenated into command strings
- Whitelist validation prevents execution of unauthorized commands
- Runspace isolation prevents access to dangerous cmdlets

### Integration with Existing System

**Claude Response Parsing**:
- Parse "RECOMMENDED: TEST - Run unit tests" format
- Extract command type and sanitize details
- Validate against whitelist before execution
- Log parsing results and execution decisions

**Safety Framework Integration**:
- Use existing Unity-Claude-Safety confidence thresholds
- Integrate with existing backup and rollback mechanisms
- Leverage current dry-run capabilities
- Maintain existing human approval workflows

### Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Manual Effort** - Automatic execution of safe, validated commands
2. **Faster Feedback Loops** - Immediate test/build execution after fixes
3. **Comprehensive Audit Trail** - Full logging of all automated actions
4. **Maintained Security** - Constrained execution environment
5. **Human Oversight** - Manual approval for uncertain commands

## Conclusion

Automated command execution can be implemented safely for Unity development by:
1. Using constrained PowerShell runspaces with whitelisted commands
2. Implementing strict parameter validation and sanitization
3. Maintaining comprehensive logging and audit trails
4. Providing human override capabilities for edge cases

This approach provides the automation benefits while maintaining security through defense-in-depth principles.
