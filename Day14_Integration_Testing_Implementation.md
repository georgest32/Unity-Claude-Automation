### Task 4: Autonomous Operation State Tracking (30-45 minutes)
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive state management for autonomous operation

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create state machine for autonomous operation phases

**Success Criteria**: Autonomous agent can track and recover its state across interruptions

## Afternoon Session (2 hours): Performance Optimization

### Task 5: Processing Pipeline Optimization (45-60 minutes)
**Objective**: Optimize the feedback loop for minimal latency

**Actions**:
- [ ] Profile current pipeline performance and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize file I/O operations with efficient caching
- [ ] Streamline JSON parsing and data transformation
- [ ] Optimize regex patterns and string processing
- [ ] Add pipeline performance monitoring

**Success Criteria**: Reduce cycle time by 30% compared to baseline

### Task 6: Concurrent Processing Implementation (45-60 minutes)
**Objective**: Add safe parallel processing where beneficial

**Actions**:
- [ ] Identify parallelizable operations (file monitoring, parsing, etc.)
- [ ] Implement ThreadJob-based concurrent processing
- [ ] Add thread-safe data sharing mechanisms
- [ ] Create resource throttling and coordination
- [ ] Add concurrent operation monitoring

**Success Criteria**: Critical path operations run in parallel without race conditions

### Task 7: Resource Usage Optimization (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Optimize for long-running autonomous sessions

**Actions**:
- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring and cleanup
- [ ] Add periodic garbage collection triggers
- [ ] Optimize log file rotation and cleanup
- [ ] Create resource usage alerting
- [ ] Add session cleanup on termination

**Success Criteria**: Memory usage remains stable during 4+ hour autonomous sessions

## Implementation Details

### New Module: Unity-Claude-IntegrationEngine.psm1

**Core Functions**:
```powershell
Start-AutonomousFeedbackLoop     # Main orchestration function
Stop-AutonomousFeedbackLoop      # Graceful shutdown
Get-FeedbackLoopStatus          # Current state and metrics
Resume-FeedbackLoopSession      # Continue from saved state
```

**Integration Points**:
- Unity-Claude-AutonomousAgent.psm1 (FileSystemWatcher)
- Unity-Claude-ResponseParser.psm1 (Claude response analysis)
- SafeCommandExecution.psm1 (Command execution)
- Unity-Claude-Intelligence.psm1 (Prompt generation)
- CLIAutomation.psm1 (Claude input submission)

### Session Persistence Schema
```json
{
  "SessionId": "uuid",
  "StartTime": "2025-08-18T10:00:00Z",
  "LastActivity": "2025-08-18T10:30:00Z",
  "CycleCount": 15,
  "SuccessfulCycles": 13,
  "ConversationHistory": [...],
  "CurrentState": "WaitingForResponse",
  "LastPrompt": "...",
  "LastResponse": "...",
  "Metrics": {...}
}
```

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| Cycle Latency | TBD | <30 seconds | TBD |
| Memory Usage | TBD | <100MB stable | TBD |
| Success Rate | TBD | >85% | TBD |
| Concurrent Operations | 1 | 3-5 | 3-5x |

## Testing Strategy

### End-to-End Tests
1. **Single Cycle Test**: Complete one feedback loop cycle
2. **Multi-Cycle Test**: 10+ consecutive autonomous cycles
3. **Interruption Recovery Test**: Resume after planned interruption
4. **Error Recovery Test**: Handle and recover from various error conditions
5. **Performance Load Test**: Extended operation under simulated load

### Success Validation
- [ ] Autonomous operation for 4+ hours without human intervention
- [ ] Conversation context preserved across session restarts
- [ ] Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
- [ ] Resource usage remains stable during extended operation
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms function correctly
