- **Ollama**: Local AI ready for relationship explanations

### Existing System Integration
- **Enhanced Documentation System**: Seamless integration achieved
- **Predictive Analysis (Week 4)**: Ready for future integration
- **Unity-Claude Modules**: Successfully analyzes existing modules

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Incomplete D3.js Implementation**
   - Risk: Limited visualization capabilities
   - Mitigation: Focus on completing core D3.js in Week 3 Day 11

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: Unknown performance with 500+ nodes
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimization strategies

3. **Real-Time Update Complexity**
   - Risk: FileSystemWatcher integration challenges
   - Mitigation: Leverage existing monitoring modules

### Opportunities

1. **Leverage Existing Modules**: Many Unity-Claude modules already implement monitoring
2. **AI Enhancement Ready**: Week 1 AI integration provides immediate enhancement path
3. **Strong Foundation**: AST analysis module provides solid base for expansion

## Recommendations for Week 3

### Priority Actions

1. **Complete D3.js Implementation** (Day 11, Hours 1-4)
   - Implement force-directed network graph
   - Add interactive features (drag, zoom, selection)
   - Test with real module data

2. **FileSystemWatcher Integration** (Day 11, Hours 5-8)
   - Leverage existing Unity-Claude monitoring modules
   - Implement incremental update pipeline
   - Test real-time visualization updates

3. **Performance Optimization** (Day 12)
   - Benchmark current performance
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize for 500+ node scenarios

### Resource Requirements

- **Technical**: Node.js expertise for D3.js completion
- **Testing**: Large module set for scale testing
- **Time**: Full Week 3 allocation for real-time intelligence

## Success Probability Analysis

### Week 2 Achievement: 60% Complete

**Breakdown:**
- Core Infrastructure: 90% complete
