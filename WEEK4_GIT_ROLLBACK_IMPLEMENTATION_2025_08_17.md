# Week 4: Git-based Rollback Mechanism Implementation
*Date: 2025-08-17 19:45*
*Phase 4 - Advanced Features: Git Integration*
*Status: PLANNING & IMPLEMENTATION*

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Need automated rollback mechanism for failed Unity compilation fixes
**Context**: Phase 3 safety framework complete with 100% test success rate
**Objective**: Implement Posh-Git integration with automated commit creation and rollback triggers
**Previous Status**: Week 3 safety framework completed, ready for Week 4 Git rollback
**Current Phase**: Week 4 implementation according to IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md lines 180-184

## Home State Analysis

### Project Structure Review
- **Repository Root**: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\
- **Working Directory**: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Unity-Claude-Automation\
- **Unity Project**: C:\UnityProjects\Sound-and-Shoal\Dithering\ 
- **Git Status**: Repository confirmed (gitStatus shows current branch: agent/docs-accuracy-setup)

### Current Implementation Status
**Phase 3 COMPLETE** âœ…
- Safety framework: 14/14 tests passing (100% success rate)
- PowerShell 5.1 compatibility fixes applied
- Critical test logic error resolved (PowerShell reference semantics)
- Enhanced debugging capabilities validated

**Phase 4 IN PROGRESS** ðŸ”„
- Rapid window switching: WORKING (610ms total time)
- Periodic monitoring: IMPLEMENTED
- **Next**: Git-based rollback mechanism (Week 4)

### Current Objectives (from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
1. **Zero-touch error resolution** - Automatically detect, analyze, and fix Unity compilation errors
2. **Intelligent feedback loop** - Learn from successful fixes and apply patterns  
3. **Dual-mode operation** - Support both API (background) and CLI (interactive) modes
4. **Modular architecture** - Extensible plugin-based system for future enhancements

### Week 4 Implementation Plan (from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md lines 180-184)
- [ ] **Posh-Git integration setup**
- [ ] **Automated commit creation** 
- [ ] **Rollback triggers on failure**
- [ ] **Complete system integration and testing**

## Current Errors/Warnings Analysis
**Status**: No immediate errors reported
**Safety Framework**: All tests passing per user confirmation
**Next Phase**: Ready to proceed with Git rollback implementation

## Preliminary Solution Analysis

### Git Integration Requirements
1. **Posh-Git Module**: PowerShell Git integration for repository operations
2. **Automated Commits**: Create commits before applying fixes for rollback capability
3. **Failure Detection**: Integrate with safety framework to trigger rollbacks
4. **System Integration**: Connect with existing Unity-Claude-Automation modules

### Implementation Flow
1. **Pre-Fix**: Create automatic commit with current state
2. **Apply Fix**: Use existing safety framework to apply changes
3. **Validate**: Check compilation success with Unity
4. **Decision**: Commit changes (success) or rollback (failure)

## Research Requirements (Preliminary)
- Posh-Git module compatibility with PowerShell 5.1
- Git commit automation best practices
- Integration with existing Unity-Claude-Safety module
- Rollback trigger mechanisms for compilation failures
- Performance considerations for frequent Git operations

## Implementation Benchmarks
- **Git Operations**: <5s for commit/rollback operations
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing safety framework
- **Reliability**: 99%+ success rate for rollback operations
- **Compatibility**: Full PowerShell 5.1 support

## Critical Files for Review
- IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md - Current implementation plan
- Modules/Unity-Claude-Safety/ - Safety framework integration point
- Unity-Claude-Automation.ps1 - Main orchestration script
- Test-SafetyFramework.ps1 - Testing framework for validation

## Success Metrics for Week 4
- [ ] Posh-Git module installed and configured
- [ ] Automated commit creation before fix application
- [ ] Rollback triggers on compilation failure
- [ ] Integration tests passing (>90% success rate)
- [ ] Documentation updated with Git workflow
