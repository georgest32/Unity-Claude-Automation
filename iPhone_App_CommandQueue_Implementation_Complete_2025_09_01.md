### âœ… Hour 7-8: Advanced Features - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Current Status**: Core infrastructure complete, advanced features ready for next phase

## Architecture Overview

### TCA State Management
```swift
CommandQueueFeature.State {
  queuedCommands: IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand>     // Priority-ordered FIFO queue
  executingCommands: IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand>   // Currently executing commands  
  completedCommands: IdentifiedArrayOf<QueuedCommand>   // Recently completed (last 100)
  maxConcurrentExecutions: Int = 3                     // Adaptive concurrency limit
  queueStatistics: QueueStatistics                    // Performance metrics
  systemResourceUsage: SystemResourceUsage            // System monitoring
}
```

### Priority Queue Algorithm
- **Primary Sort**: Priority level (urgent â†’ high â†’ normal â†’ low)
- **Secondary Sort**: Enqueue timestamp (FIFO within same priority)
- **Dynamic Insertion**: Real-time priority-based queue reordering
- **Concurrency Control**: Configurable execution slots with resource monitoring

### Command Lifecycle
1. **Prompt Submission** â†’ CommandRequest creation in PromptFeature
2. **Queue Enqueue** â†’ Priority-based insertion into queuedCommands
3. **Execution Start** â†’ Move to executingCommands, start async Task
4. **Progress Updates** â†’ Real-time progress reporting via TCA actions
5. **Completion** â†’ Move to completedCommands with results
6. **Cancellation** â†’ Cooperative cancellation at any stage
