## üìö PRELIMINARY SOLUTION ANALYSIS

### Week 5 Day 2 Implementation Requirements Analysis

#### Hour 1-2: Email Module Enhancement (Building on Foundation)
**Current Status**: Basic email module exists with System.Net.Mail
**Needed**: Enhanced email sending functions with retry logic and integration hooks
**Implementation**: Extend existing module with Send-EmailWithRetry and integration functions

#### Hour 3-4: Error Handling and Reliability  
**Requirements**: Production-grade retry logic for email delivery failures
**Implementation**: Exponential backoff retry pattern for SMTP failures
**Integration**: Email delivery status tracking and comprehensive error reporting

#### Hour 5-6: Unity-Claude Workflow Integration (CRITICAL)
**Requirements**: Connect email notifications to all major workflow events
**Integration Points**:
- Unity compilation error detection ‚Üí Email notifications
- Claude API/CLI failures ‚Üí Email alerts  
- Workflow creation/status changes ‚Üí Email notifications
- Performance threshold breaches ‚Üí Email alerts

#### Hour 7-8: Email System Testing
**Requirements**: Comprehensive testing of integrated email notification system
**Validation**: Email notifications triggered by actual workflow events
**Performance**: Ensure notifications don't impact core workflow performance

## üî¨ RESEARCH FINDINGS (Web Query: 1)

### Research Query 1: PowerShell Event-Driven Notifications and Workflow Integration
- **Key Finding**: PowerShell Universal triggers enable automation jobs when certain events happen
- **Event Registration**: Register-ObjectEvent allows triggering scripts on Windows Events (event IDs)
- **Workflow Integration**: Event-driven architecture with production, detection, consumption, and reaction patterns
- **Trigger Types**: Polling triggers (check at intervals) vs webhook triggers (real-time event listeners)
- **Performance**: Webhook triggers avoid delays but polling triggers are more reliable for missed events
- **Best Practices**: Use trigger conditions to ensure flows run only when specific criteria are met

### Research Application to Week 5 Day 2 Implementation
Based on research findings, the integration approach will be:
1. **Event Registration**: Use PowerShell event patterns for Unity compilation and Claude workflow events
2. **Trigger Conditions**: Implement conditional logic to prevent notification spam
3. **Polling Strategy**: Regular monitoring with event detection rather than real-time webhooks
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure notification triggers don't impact core workflow performance
