## üî¨ RESEARCH FINDINGS (Web Queries: 5)

### Research Query 1: Multi-Channel Notification Systems
- **Key Finding**: Enterprise systems like Prometheus Alertmanager, Novu, and Grafana provide unified APIs for multi-channel notifications
- **Implementation Patterns**: Single template system serving email, webhook, Slack, SMS with channel-specific formatting
- **Architecture**: Unified notification workflows with conditions for each channel (Inbox/In-App, Push, Email, SMS, Chat)
- **Template Flexibility**: Custom webhook payload templates allowing complete customization using template variables

### Research Query 2: PowerShell Template Engines and Variable Substitution
- **Key Finding**: System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) uses PowerShell for notification channels with substitution strings
- **Variable Substitution**: Token replacement with hashtables for large template files using -replace operations
- **EPS Templating Engine**: Dedicated PowerShell templating with Invoke-EpsTemplate and hashtable binding
- **Template Processing**: Service Manager supports substitution strings for dynamic content generation

### Research Query 3: Severity-Based Routing and Channel Selection
- **Key Finding**: Industry standard severity levels: Critical (immediate action), Error (actionable), Warning (low urgency), Info (non-actionable)
- **Channel Selection**: Critical/Error ‚Üí High-urgency channels (email, SMS, calls), Warning ‚Üí Low-urgency (tickets), Info ‚Üí Suppressed/logged
- **Routing Algorithms**: Hierarchical routing rules with severity-to-urgency mappings and escalation policies
- **Dynamic Notifications**: PagerDuty and similar systems use severity-based channel selection with automatic escalation

### Research Query 4: Template Standardization and Content Management
- **Key Finding**: Template standardization streamlines content creation and maintains brand consistency
- **Reusability Patterns**: Composable "chunks" of content reused across templates and updated independently
- **Multi-Format Support**: Templates supporting PDF, XLSX, HTML, email content for different delivery methods
- **Version Control**: Template versioning with testing, previews, and conflict avoidance through unique naming

### Research Query 5: Content Validation and Testing Systems
- **Key Finding**: Modern systems provide template testing capabilities with preview and validation
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Cross-field dependency validation and logical consistency checks
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate error catching during template design and content entry
- **Testing Approaches**: Template testing with sample data before deployment to ensure proper rendering

### Research Application to Week 5 Day 5 Implementation
Based on research findings, the implementation approach will be:
1. **Unified Template System**: Single template engine serving both email and webhook with channel-specific formatting
2. **Severity Routing**: Critical ‚Üí Email+Webhook, Error ‚Üí Email+Webhook, Warning ‚Üí Email, Info ‚Üí Webhook/Logged
3. **Content Standardization**: Composable template components with variable substitution and version management
