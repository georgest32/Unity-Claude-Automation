# Module Export Fix - Unity-Claude-Learning-Simple
Date: 2025-08-17
Status: FIXED
Issue: Unnecessary test skipping

## Problem Identified
The test suite was skipping the "Update Pattern Success" test because it couldn't find the `Update-FixSuccess` function, even though the function was implemented in the module.

## Root Cause
The `Update-FixSuccess` function (lines 363-404 in Unity-Claude-Learning-Simple.psm1) was implemented but NOT exported in the module manifest. PowerShell modules only expose functions listed in the `FunctionsToExport` array.

## Solution Applied
Added `Update-FixSuccess` to the FunctionsToExport array in Unity-Claude-Learning-Simple.psd1

## Why Tests Were Being Skipped
We were skipping tests unnecessarily because:
1. The function existed but wasn't accessible from outside the module
2. The test assumed if the function wasn't found, it must be a SQLite-only feature
3. This was actually a module configuration issue, not a missing feature

## Impact
- No more skipped tests - all 15 tests should now pass
- Function is now available for external use if needed
- Test suite will properly validate the success tracking functionality

## Module Status
The Unity-Claude-Learning-Simple module now exports ALL its public functions including:
- Core functions (Initialize, Add patterns, Get fixes, etc.)
- AST parsing functions (Get-CodeAST, Find-CodePattern, etc.)
- Unity error patterns (Get-UnityErrorPattern)
- Success tracking (Update-FixSuccess)

## Next Steps
Run the test suite again - all tests should pass without any skips.
