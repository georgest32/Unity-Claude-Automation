# Unity-Claude-SystemStatus Module Refactoring Progress
*Implementation tracking for breaking up the 6,622-line monolithic module*
*Date Started: 2025-08-20*
*Implementation Type: Continue*
*Previous Context: 83% duplication rate, orphaned code at line 3670*

## Current Status
*Last Updated: 2025-08-20 16:40*

### Phase 1: Analysis & Backup (Day 1, Hours 1-2) - COMPLETED
- [x] Hour 1: Complete Analysis
  - [x] Create full function inventory - Found 100 definitions, 50 duplicates
  - [x] Map all duplications precisely - Every function duplicated exactly once  
  - [x] Identify all orphaned code fragments - 110 fragments found
  - [x] Document current public API - 50 unique functions identified
- [x] Hour 2: Backup & Safety
  - [x] Create Unity-Claude-SystemStatus-ORIGINAL.psm1 backup - Done earlier
  - [x] Create API compatibility test script - Test-SystemStatusAPICompatibility.ps1
  - [x] Document all exported functions - List created
  - [x] Create rollback plan - Can restore from ORIGINAL backup

### Phase 2: Remove Duplicates (Day 1, Hours 3-4) - IN PROGRESS
**Hour 3: Clean Duplicate Regions**
- [x] Created Remove-SystemStatusDuplicates.ps1 script
- [x] Ran deduplication: 6,622 → 3,658 lines (44.76% reduction)
- [x] Removed 50 duplicate functions successfully
- [x] Fixed 3 unclosed regions
- [x] Removed 15 orphaned code lines
- [ ] **ISSUE**: Deduplication broke try-catch block structure
- [ ] **NEXT**: Need more sophisticated AST-based deduplication

**Hour 4: Fix Structural Issues**
- [x] Identified try-catch block issues in deduplicated version
- [x] Created Fix-SystemStatusTryCatch.ps1 (partial success)
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Simple line removal breaks nested code structures
- [ ] **SOLUTION**: Need AST-aware block removal

### Phase 3: Create Module Structure (Day 1, Hours 5-6) - PENDING
### Phase 4: Extract Functional Groups (Day 2, Hours 1-4) - PENDING
### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Day 2, Hours 5-6) - PENDING

## Current State
- **Module Status**: Original module loads successfully after corruption fix
- **Module Size**: Still 6,622 lines (using original with fix)
- **Duplicate Functions**: 50 functions, each defined twice
- **Duplication Rate**: 100% for functions (0 unique functions!)
- **Known Issues**: 
  - 110 orphaned code fragments throughout
  - 3 unclosed regions
  - Deduplication approach needs refinement

## Objectives
1. ✅ Backup created
2. ✅ Analysis complete  
3. ⚠️ Deduplication attempted but needs refinement
4. ⏳ Module structure pending
5. ⏳ Submodule extraction pending
6. ✅ Backward compatibility test created

## Progress Metrics
- **Lines Analyzed**: 6,622/6,622 ✅
- **Duplicates Found**: 50 functions
- **Orphaned Code Found**: 110 fragments
- **Functions Inventoried**: 100/100 ✅
- **Submodules Created**: 0/15

## Key Findings
1. **Every single function is duplicated** - not just some
2. **110 orphaned code fragments** - more than expected
3. **Simple deduplication breaks structure** - need AST-aware approach
4. **Original module works** - can continue using while refactoring

## Next Steps
1. Create AST-aware deduplication that preserves code block structure
2. OR: Manually extract functions one by one into new structure
3. Test each extraction to ensure functionality preserved
4. Create module loader that sources all submodules

## Tools Created
1. **Analyze-SystemStatusModule.ps1** - AST-based analysis (works)
2. **Test-SystemStatusAPICompatibility.ps1** - API testing
3. **Remove-SystemStatusDuplicates.ps1** - Deduplication (needs improvement)
4. **Fix-SystemStatusTryCatch.ps1** - Try-catch fixer (partial)

## Blockers
- Deduplication breaks nested code structures (try-catch, if-else)
- Need more sophisticated AST manipulation
- Consider manual extraction as alternative approach
