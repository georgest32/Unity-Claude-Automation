# CLI Orchestrator JSON Parsing Fix
**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Issue**: Response file processing showing "Cannot index into a null array" errors  
**Resolution**: Fixed incorrect array indexing of PowerShell automatic $matches variable

## Problem Description
When CLI Orchestrator processes JSON response files, 8 out of 10 files were failing with:
```
Error processing response file: Cannot index into a null array.
```

Only 2 files were processing successfully but finding 0 recommendations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurred in `AutonomousOperations.psm1` in the `Process-ResponseFile` function. The code was incorrectly treating the PowerShell automatic `$matches` variable as an array of Match objects when it's actually a hashtable.

### PowerShell -match Operator Behavior
- When using `-match`, PowerShell creates an automatic `$matches` hashtable
- `$matches[0]` contains the full match
- `$matches[1]`, `$matches[2]`, etc. contain capture groups
- The code was trying to access `$matches[0].Groups[1].Value` which doesn't exist

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed File: Modules\Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator\Core\AutonomousOperations.psm1

**Lines 448, 450**: Fixed confidence extraction
```powershell
# OLD (incorrect):
$processedResponse.ConfidenceLevel = $matches[0].Groups[1].Value + "%"
$processedResponse.ConfidenceLevel = $matches[0].Groups[1].Value

# NEW (fixed):
$processedResponse.ConfidenceLevel = $matches[1] + "%"
$processedResponse.ConfidenceLevel = $matches[1]
```

**Line 458**: Fixed action type extraction
```powershell
# OLD (incorrect):
$actionType = $matches[0].Groups[1].Value

# NEW (fixed):
$actionType = $matches[1]
```

## Impact
This fix resolves the array indexing errors and allows the response files to be processed correctly. The system can now:
- Parse all JSON response files without errors
- Extract recommendations from the RESPONSE field
- Identify confidence levels
- Generate next actions based on recommendations

## Testing
The fix should immediately resolve the "Cannot index into a null array" errors. The next monitoring cycle should show:
- All 10 response files processing without errors
- Proper extraction of recommendations where they exist
- Accurate confidence level detection

## Related Components
- Unity-Claude-CLIOrchestrator module
- AutonomousOperations.psm1 (contains Process-ResponseFile function)
- ResponseAnalysisEngine.psm1 (calls Process-ResponseFile)
- Start-CLIOrchestration function (orchestrates the monitoring loop)
