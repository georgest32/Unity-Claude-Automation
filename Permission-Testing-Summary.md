# Auto-Approval Testing Summary

## Date: 2024-08-31

### Current Settings Configuration
Location: `.claude/settings.json`

### Testing Results

#### ✅ Commands that ARE Auto-Approved:
- `echo` - Basic echo commands
- `ls` - Directory listing  
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `git status` - Git status checks
- `Read` tool - File reading operations
- `Glob` tool - File pattern matching
- `Write` tool - File writing operations
- `Edit` tool - File editing operations

#### ❌ Commands that Still Require Approval:
- `dir` (Windows native dir command via cmd)
- `cmd /c dir` - Windows command prompt operations
- PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-ChildItem`, `Select-Object`
- Piped commands with `|`

### Key Findings:
1. Basic Unix-style commands (ls, pwd, echo) are working with auto-approval
2. Git read-only operations are auto-approved
3. Claude tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob) are auto-approved
4. Windows-specific commands (dir, cmd) are NOT auto-approved despite being in allow list
5. PowerShell cmdlets are NOT auto-approved even with wildcard patterns

### Possible Issues:
1. The pattern matching for `Bash(dir*)` may not be working as expected
2. Windows commands might need different permission syntax
3. PowerShell commands might be interpreted differently by Claude CLI

### Current Permissions Configuration:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(*)",
      "Bash(ls*)",
      "Bash(dir*)",
      "Bash(pwd*)",
      "Bash(cd*)",
      "Bash(cat*)",
      "Bash(echo*)",
      "Bash(type*)",
      "Bash(Get-*)",
      "Bash(Test-*)",
      "Bash(Select-*)",
      "Bash(Where-*)",
      "Bash(ForEach-*)",
      "Bash(git status*)",
      "Bash(git diff*)",
      "Bash(git log*)",
      "Bash(git branch*)",
      "Bash(git show*)",
      "Read(*)",
      "Glob(*)",
      "Grep(*)",
      "Edit(*)",
      "MultiEdit(*)",
      "Write(*)",
      "Task(*)",
      "BashOutput(*)",
      "TodoWrite(*)",
      "WebSearch(*)",
      "WebFetch(*)",
      "ExitPlanMode(*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf*)",
      "Bash(Remove-Item -Recurse -Force*)",
      "Bash(del /f /s /q*)",
      "Bash(format*)",
      "Bash(diskpart*)",
      "Bash(sudo*)",
      "Bash(git push --force*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard*)",
      "KillBash(*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Recommendations:
1. The auto-approval is partially working
2. Most safe read operations are being auto-approved
3. Windows-specific commands may need additional configuration or different syntax
4. Consider if Windows commands need to be run through WSL or Git Bash instead of cmd
