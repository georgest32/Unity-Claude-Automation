# Phase 3: Windows Event Log Integration - Implementation Tracking
*Created: 2025-08-22*
*Type: Implementation Tracking Document*

## Executive Summary
**Project**: Unity-Claude Automation System
**Phase**: 3 - Windows Event Log Integration
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enterprise integration enhancement
**Duration**: 1 week (Week 7 of overall implementation)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Day 1

## Problem Context
The Unity-Claude Automation system currently uses file-based logging (unity_claude_automation.log) and custom JSON event tracking. While functional, this approach lacks enterprise-grade integration with Windows Event infrastructure, limiting visibility for system administrators and preventing correlation with other Windows system events.

## Objectives & Benchmarks
### Primary Objectives
1. Create custom Windows Event Log source for Unity-Claude Automation
2. Implement structured event logging with proper severity levels
3. Enable event correlation and filtering for system administrators
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing file-based logging

### Success Benchmarks
- Event log write performance: <100ms per write operation
- Zero permission errors when running with standard user privileges
- 100% compatibility with PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+
- Complete error handling for all event log operations
- Structured event data supporting XPath queries

## Implementation Plan
### Week 7: Windows Event Log Integration

#### Days 1-2: Event Log Infrastructure (TODAY - TOMORROW)
**Hour 1-3: Create custom event source registration system**
- Research event source creation requirements
- Implement New-EventLog wrapper with error handling
- Create event source validation and registration checks
- Handle admin privilege requirements gracefully

**Hour 4-6: Implement Write-EventLog wrapper with error handling**
- Create unified event writing interface
- Support multiple event types (Information, Warning, Error, Critical)
- Implement structured data for event properties
- Add retry logic for transient failures

**Hour 7-8: Build Get-WinEvent query optimization framework**
- Create efficient XPath query builders
- Implement performance-optimized filtering
- Support both classic and modern event log formats
- Add event correlation capabilities

#### Days 3-4: Integration Points
**Hour 1-4: Integrate event logging throughout Unity-Claude workflow**
- Unity compilation error events
- Claude submission events
- Autonomous agent state changes
- System status monitoring events

**Hour 5-8: Create event correlation and analysis tools**
- Event aggregation functions
- Pattern detection for recurring issues
- Performance metric extraction from events
- Reporting and dashboard integration

#### Day 5: Testing & Validation
**Hour 1-4: Test event log writing with proper permissions**
- Standard user permission testing
- Administrator privilege testing
- UAC elevation scenarios
- Cross-version compatibility tests

**Hour 5-8: Validate event log reading and filtering performance**
- Load testing with high event volumes
- XPath query performance benchmarks
- Remote computer access testing
- Event retention and rotation validation

## Technical Specifications
### Event Source Configuration
- **Event Log Name**: "Unity-Claude-Automation"
- **Event Source**: "Unity-Claude-Agent"
- **Event ID Ranges**:
  - 1000-1999: Information events
  - 2000-2999: Warning events
  - 3000-3999: Error events
  - 4000-4999: Critical events
  - 5000-5999: Performance metrics

### Structured Event Data Schema
```powershell
@{
    Timestamp = [DateTime]
    Component = [String] # Unity, Claude, Agent, Monitor
    Action = [String] # CompilationStart, SubmissionComplete, etc.
    Result = [String] # Success, Failure, Warning
    Duration = [Int32] # Milliseconds
    Details = [Hashtable] # Component-specific data
    CorrelationId = [Guid] # For tracking related events
}
```

## Module Structure
### New Module: Unity-Claude-EventLog
Location: `Modules\Unity-Claude-EventLog\`

Files to create:
- `Unity-Claude-EventLog.psd1` - Module manifest
- `Unity-Claude-EventLog.psm1` - Module implementation
- `Core\Initialize-EventLogSource.ps1` - Event source registration
- `Core\Write-UCEventLog.ps1` - Event writing wrapper
- `Core\Get-UCEventLog.ps1` - Event reading wrapper
- `Query\New-UCEventQuery.ps1` - XPath query builder
- `Analysis\Get-UCEventCorrelation.ps1` - Event correlation
- `Tests\Test-EventLogIntegration.ps1` - Integration tests

## Dependencies & Compatibility
### PowerShell Version Requirements
- **PowerShell 5.1**: Full support with Get-EventLog/Write-EventLog
- **PowerShell 7+**: Requires WindowsCompatibility module for classic cmdlets
- **Cross-version**: Use Get-WinEvent for maximum compatibility

### Permission Requirements
- **Event Source Creation**: Administrator privileges required (one-time)
- **Event Writing**: Standard user privileges sufficient after source creation
- **Event Reading**: Standard user privileges for local logs

### .NET Framework Dependencies
- System.Diagnostics.EventLog (available in all versions)
- System.Security.Principal (for privilege checking)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
### Identified Risks
1. **Permission Issues**: Event source creation requires admin rights
   - Mitigation: Provide separate setup script with clear instructions
   
2. **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Different cmdlets in PS 5.1 vs PS 7
   - Mitigation: Abstract behind wrapper functions with version detection
   
3. **Performance Impact**: Event log writes could slow down operations
   - Mitigation: Asynchronous writing with queuing mechanism
   
4. **Event Log Size Management**: Logs could grow unbounded
   - Mitigation: Configure maximum log size and retention policies

## Current Progress (Day 1 - Hour 1)
- [x] Created implementation tracking document
- [ ] Research Windows Event Log APIs and PowerShell cmdlets
- [ ] Design module structure and interfaces
- [ ] Begin implementation of core components

## Next Steps
1. Complete research phase on Windows Event Log integration
2. Create Unity-Claude-EventLog module structure
3. Implement Initialize-EventLogSource.ps1
4. Test event source creation with proper error handling

## Important Learnings
- PowerShell 7 deprecates some classic event log cmdlets
- Get-WinEvent provides better performance than Get-EventLog
- Event source registration is persistent across reboots
- XPath queries significantly outperform Where-Object filtering

## Test Validation Checklist
- [ ] Event source creation succeeds with admin rights
- [ ] Event source creation fails gracefully without admin rights
- [ ] Events write successfully to custom log
- [ ] Events contain all structured data fields
- [ ] XPath queries return correct results
- [ ] Performance meets <100ms benchmark
- [ ] Cross-version compatibility verified
- [ ] Integration with existing logging maintained
