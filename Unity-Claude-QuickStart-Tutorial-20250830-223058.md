   `

2. Generate documentation:
   `powershell
   New-ProjectDocumentation -ProjectPath "C:\SampleProject" -Format Markdown
   `

3. View generated documentation:
   `powershell
   Get-GeneratedDocumentation -ProjectPath "C:\SampleProject"
   `

### Step 3: Performance Monitoring
1. View current performance metrics:
   `powershell
   Get-PerformanceMetrics -RealTime
   `

2. Generate performance report:
   `powershell
   New-PerformanceReport -Period LastHour -Format Console
   `

**Exercise 2**: Generate documentation for a sample project and review the performance impact.

## Module 3: System Monitoring (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Health Monitoring
1. Check system health:
   `powershell
   Get-SystemHealth -IncludeModules
   `

2. Monitor resource usage:
   `powershell
   Watch-ResourceUsage -Duration "5m" -Interval 30
   `

### Step 2: Alert Configuration
1. Set up basic alerts:
   `powershell
   New-BasicAlerts -Email "your.email@company.com"

`powershell
Get-PerformanceBottlenecks
`
**Solution**:
`powershell
Invoke-SystemOptimization -Mode Quick
`

#### Issue: Module Not Responding
**Diagnosis**:
`powershell
Test-ModuleHealth -ModuleName All
`
**Solution**:
`powershell
Restart-Module -ModuleName [ModuleName] -Force
`

**Exercise 4**: Simulate a performance issue and practice the troubleshooting steps.

## Module 5: Best Practices (20 minutes)
