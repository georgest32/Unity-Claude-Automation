- [x] Main orchestrator module created with component imports
- [x] Module manifest updated to use refactored version
- [x] Original file marked with refactoring markers
- [x] **Debug logging added to monolithic file** (shows "MONOLITHIC VERSION" warning)
- [x] **Debug logging added to orchestrator** (shows "REFACTORED VERSION" confirmation)
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Functions properly exported

### 📊 **Success Metrics**
- **Target**: ~85% reduction in complexity per component
- **Architecture**: Modular components in Core/ subdirectories
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Independent testability of components
