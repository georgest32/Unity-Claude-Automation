**Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Time:** 13:05 PM (Fourth Test Run - Quadruple Validation)  
**Previous Context:** Continued validation of CLIOrchestrator serialization fix for path corruption issue  
**Topics:** PowerShell serialization, object-to-string conversion, quadruple validation, production confidence  
**Problem:** Ultimate confirmation that serialization fix maintains perfect consistency across four independent test iterations  

## Analysis Overview

This fourth test run of the CLIOrchestrator serialization test represents **quadruple validation** - the highest level of consistency confirmation achieved. This analysis focuses on confirming that the implementation maintains absolute reliability across four independent test processes, providing ultimate confidence for production deployment.

## Test Context and Historical Results

### Complete Test Run History
1. **First Run (12:41 PM)**: Initial validation - 8/8 tests passed, 5.06-second execution
