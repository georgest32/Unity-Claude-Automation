### Research Findings Summary

#### 1. PowerShell 5.1 Constrained Runspaces Security (2025)
**Key Discovery**: Constrained Language Mode (CLM) + Application Control integration essential
- **CLM Implementation**: Blocks dangerous capabilities (COM objects, .NET instantiation, classes)
- **Constrained Endpoints**: NoLanguage mode for approved cmdlets only, preventing script blocks
- **Security Challenge**: AI agents require human oversight, trust-but-verify approach
- **2025 Requirement**: PowerShell v2 uninstallation, WDAC integration for v5.1
- **Bypass Prevention**: Visibility management, local admin control, network logon restrictions

#### 2. Bayesian Confidence Adjustment Algorithms
**Key Discovery**: Probabilistic inference with recursive updating for AI decision systems
- **Core Algorithm**: Recursive Bayesian updating where previous output becomes new prior
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient computational demands even with increasing data volume
- **AI Agent Integration**: Probabilistic graphical models with confidence score combination
- **Implementation Pattern**: Human-AI hybrid framework with confidence calibration
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Proven application in real-time decision-making under uncertainty

#### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern for Autonomous Systems  
**Key Discovery**: Three-state protection (Closed/Open/Half-Open) prevents cascading failures
- **Failure Prevention**: Stops failures from spreading, conserves resources, allows recovery time
- **State Management**: Closed (normal), Open (fail-fast), Half-Open (limited testing)
- **Microsoft Guidance**: Integration with IHttpClientFactory, Polly library recommended
- **Monitoring**: Clear observability for operations teams, distributed tracing essential
- **Autonomous Benefit**: Critical for preventing system-wide failures in unattended operation

#### 4. Context Compression for 200K Token Windows
**Key Discovery**: Multiple compression strategies available for large context management
- **Recurrent Context Compression (RCC)**: Divides sequences, compresses to state vectors
- **Infini-Attention**: Google's compressive memory approach, 1M+ tokens, constant memory
- **Context Distillation**: Fine-tune model to compress 100K tokens to 10K "gist"
- **Cache Management**: Static context caching, intermediate state reuse
- **Memory Scaling**: O(n·N·d) growth challenge, significant computational costs

#### 5. Entity Recognition for CLI Response Parsing
**Key Discovery**: NLP techniques adapted for command-line and code analysis
- **PowerShell Analysis**: Prefix-tree stemmers, trie data structures for nanosecond parsing
- **NER Applications**: Identifies files, commands, errors, objects in CLI responses
- **Library Options**: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP, NLTK for structured text processing  
- **ML Approaches**: CRF for sequence context, probabilistic inference for pattern detection
- **Performance**: Lower cost than regex-based detection, better unknown command handling

#### 6. PowerShell JSON Performance Optimization
**Key Discovery**: Native PowerShell JSON cmdlets have severe performance limitations
- **Performance Issue**: ConvertFrom-Json fails on 180MB+ files, 1GB memory for 6MB JSON
- **Alternative 1**: .NET JavaScriptSerializer provides significant performance gains
- **Alternative 2**: jq streaming mode for piece-by-piece processing of giant arrays
- **Alternative 3**: Third-party libraries (CsvHelper, NewtonSoft.JSON) outperform native cmdlets
- **Optimization**: Pipeline processing, AsHashtable parameter, avoid loading entire files

## Blockers and Risks

### Technical Risks
- **JSON Truncation**: Claude Code CLI known issue with response truncation
- **PowerShell 5.1 Limitations**: Constrained runspace capabilities
