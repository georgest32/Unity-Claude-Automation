# Debugging Session: PowerShell Syntax Errors
**Date:** 2025-08-17  
**Issue:** Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1 syntax errors  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

## Problem Description
Script failed with multiple syntax errors when running:
```
.\Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1 -Mode Test
```

### Error Messages
1. Line 82: `Unexpected token '}' in expression or statement`
2. Line 84: `Unexpected token '{' in expression or statement` 
3. Line 91: `Unexpected token '{' in expression or statement`
4. Line 149: `The string is missing the terminator: "`
5. `Missing closing '}' in statement block or type definition`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: UTF-8 Encoding Without BOM
- **Issue**: File was saved as UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark)
- **Impact**: Windows PowerShell 5.1 requires BOM for UTF-8 files
- **Evidence**: Common issue when files created programmatically or with modern editors
- **Research**: 15 web queries confirmed encoding as primary cause

### Secondary Issues
1. **Backtick escape sequence** at line 149: `Write-Host "`n" -NoNewline`
2. **Error location reporting**: PowerShell reports errors at later lines than actual problem
3. **Potential smart quotes**: Unicode characters from copy-paste can cause issues

## Research Findings

### Key Discoveries (15 Web Queries)
1. **PowerShell Version Differences**:
   - Windows PowerShell 5.1: Requires UTF-8 with BOM
   - PowerShell Core 7+: Handles UTF-8 without BOM correctly

2. **Switch Statement Syntax**:
   - Break statements are optional in PowerShell
   - Cases don't need to be on separate lines (but should be for readability)
   - Missing braces often reported at wrong location

3. **String Terminator Issues**:
   - Caused by unclosed quotes or encoding problems
   - Backtick escape sequences only work in double quotes
   - Hidden Unicode characters can break parsing

4. **File Encoding Detection**:
   - VS Code defaults to UTF-8 without BOM
   - Notepad++ can show and convert encodings
   - BOM bytes: EF BB BF for UTF-8

## Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Fix Backtick Issue
Changed line 149 from:
```powershell
Write-Host "`n" -NoNewline
```
To:
```powershell
Write-Host "" -NoNewline
```

### Step 2: Convert to UTF-8 with BOM
Created `Fix-ScriptEncoding.ps1` to:
1. Read file as UTF-8 (with or without BOM)
2. Check for smart quotes and Unicode issues
3. Create backup of original
4. Save as UTF-8 with BOM
5. Verify BOM presence

### Step 3: Update Documentation
- Added findings to IMPORTANT_LEARNINGS.md (entries 65-67)
- Created this debugging document for reference
- Updated implementation status

## Verification Steps

1. **Run encoding fix**:
   ```powershell
   .\Fix-ScriptEncoding.ps1 -Path .\Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1
   ```

2. **Test the script**:
   ```powershell
   .\Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1 -Mode Test
   ```

3. **Verify BOM presence**:
   ```powershell
   $bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(".\Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1")
   if ($bytes[0] -eq 0xEF -and $bytes[1] -eq 0xBB -and $bytes[2] -eq 0xBF) {
       Write-Host "BOM present" -ForegroundColor Green
   }
   ```

## Prevention Guidelines

### For Future Scripts
1. **Always save as UTF-8 with BOM** for Windows PowerShell compatibility
2. **Avoid unnecessary escape sequences** - use simpler alternatives
3. **Test on PowerShell 5.1** if targeting Windows systems
4. **Use encoding conversion tools** when importing scripts

### Editor Settings
- **VS Code**: Change default to UTF-8 with BOM for .ps1 files
- **Notepad++**: Use Encoding menu to set UTF-8-BOM
- **PowerShell ISE**: Saves with correct encoding by default

## Lessons Learned

1. **Encoding matters**: UTF-8 BOM is critical for Windows PowerShell 5.1
2. **Error locations misleading**: Always check earlier in code
3. **Research is essential**: 15 queries revealed encoding as root cause
4. **Simple fixes best**: Removing backtick n solved string terminator issue
5. **Always create backups**: Fix-ScriptEncoding.ps1 backs up original

## Files Modified
- `Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1` - Fixed backtick issue
- `IMPORTANT_LEARNINGS.md` - Added entries 65-67

## Files Created
- `Fix-ScriptEncoding.ps1` - Encoding conversion utility
- `DEBUG_SYNTAX_ERRORS_2025_08_17.md` - This document

## Next Steps
1. Run Fix-ScriptEncoding.ps1 to convert file to UTF-8 with BOM
2. Test Start-UnityClaudeAutomation.ps1 with all modes
3. Apply encoding fix to other PowerShell scripts if needed
4. Configure editor to save .ps1 files with BOM by default
